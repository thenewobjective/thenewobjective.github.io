The first couple decades of my life were overall not very pleasant. One chapter of this was when we lived with an uncle for a short time in a small town in Oklahoma: Picher-Cardin. I was surprised recently to find out that a documentary was made about the place. You may find it interesting and it describes the area and situation better than I could have:

Google maps also [has some images](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Picher-cardin,+OK/@36.947349,-94.8311885,3a,75y,100h,90t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipPT-k5rDtC74ko4G4N37b8unpHX9QET5U2U62Wp!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPT-k5rDtC74ko4G4N37b8unpHX9QET5U2U62Wp%3Dw86-h86-k-no-pi6.069931-ya347.2374-ro3.1031055-fo100!7i5376!8i2688!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x87c810fa5f96903b:0xdf574dc020f66982!2sPicher-cardin,+OK!3b1!8m2!3d36.9737678!4d-94.8416936!3m4!1s0x87c810fa5f96903b:0xdf574dc020f66982!8m2!3d36.9737678!4d-94.8416936){:target="_blank"}.

We were also told that biker gangs would dump bodies in the old mines. I never saw this myself, but it wouldn't have been surpising.

On Wikipedia you can find more details under the [Tar Creek Superfund site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_Creek_Superfund_site){:target="_blank"}.
