While continuing my experiments with [Dream incubation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_incubation), I've
discovered that I receive symbolic images primarily in the [Hypnopompic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnopompic)
stage. The following unprompted symbolism I don't understand yet.

In a field of black a sword stood, perhaps laid against an unseen object. The base of the sword was cradled in blue flowers divorced from their stems. Below is a rough painting of the imagery:

In a poor attempt at interpretation, I got the impression that the blackness was water, perhaps a form of
[Chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(cosmogony)#Biblical_tradition). In the western tradition we
usually think of a single [sword of significance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excalibur), but I don't
think that applied here. The most interesting part of this that took me down a rabbit hole was my effort
to understand what the [blue flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_flower) might represent. It seems
traditionally they represent "the metaphysical striving for the infinite and unreachable":

> They taught me longing - Sehnsucht; made me for good or ill,

This word, Sehnsucht, until now I only knew of it culturally from the
[Rammstein song and album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sehnsucht_(Rammstein_album))
but apparently it's also a [psychological term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sehnsucht).
A "longing, specifically longing for some unknown joy". This reminds me of Thoreau's comment
in *[Walden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden)*:

> The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation.
> From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the
> bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what
> are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work.
> But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.
