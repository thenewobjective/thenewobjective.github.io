Once as I laid in bed a twilight dream came to me. This dream was a vision of code. All scopes were colored purple and blue and were in conflict with one another. These colors were not static but fluid and flowed through the contours of function calls and methods.  The colors burned each other where they met and a smoke rose from the boundaries. Across this landscape of contoured antipodes I could also see pits and pillars. Every contradiction in logic was a singularity eating the area around it. The pillars were in fact swells where some Leviathan of code laid beneath and pulled the surrounding fluid above it like a tide. I could not perceive what this code was for as I was too close to it as it swept me along. Soon I awoke, wondering what it was that I discovered.
