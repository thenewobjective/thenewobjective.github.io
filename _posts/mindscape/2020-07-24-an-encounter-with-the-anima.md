For many men, myself included, the above poem is inspirational and reflective of who we are and/or who we want to be. Such a persona though is insufficient.
According to [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung){:target="_blank"} men and women are a duality, not just with one another but within themselves.
The feminine aspect of men being [Anima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_and_animus){:target="_blank"},
and the masculine aspect of women being [Animus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_and_animus){:target="_blank"}. Symbolically this may be best represented by
the yin-yang symbol:

Proper recognition and integration of these aspects is necessary and the failure to do so leads do
[dysfunction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exqL4C2u7HA){:target="_blank"} in our behavior and lives.

I believe my Anima gave me a hard warning last night via a dream:

The theme of the dream was me being a Sergeant again in the Marine Corp. I was working to prepare a platoon for a large scale exercise.
At some point I left the group to obtain some gear of my own. On my return I was stopped by a female marine in emotional distress.
In retrospect I identify her as my Anima.

> Anima: "You did this to me. You did this to us."<br>
> Me: "But you chose this. All of your siblings did as well. Did they regret it?"<br>
> <br>
> Anima: "No, but I do."<br>
> Me: "But I'm the leader now, we have a direction."<br>
> <br>
> Anima: "But I don't feel safe!"

I then moved foward to comfort her when she exclaimed:

> "Ow! Something's wrong; it hurts!

She holds her head and collapses.

I pick her up and yell for a medic as I run towards the treatment area.
I arrive and an older woman in her 40s and grossly overweight appear dressed as a nurse.
I lay Anima on the table/bed and explain the situation. The "nurse" examines her somewhat
but seems completely incompetent. Anima is now unconscious yet strangely I can still
hear her thoughts in my mind and it's panic. I speak to her and she hears:

> "Can you hear me? Can you feel me?<br>
> Hold my hand and listen to my voice.<br>
> It'll be okay. Just hold on, just hold on..."

In retrospect I think the "nurse" was also a personification of the Anima but a separate aspect.
Both are sick in different ways. I haven't had much time to reflect on this yet to identify the
problem(s) more specifically but identifying that there is a problem is a start. If the above
poem continues to inspire me without exception perhaps that's a hint?
