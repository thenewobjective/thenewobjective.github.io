"Make sure your Manitous adds to the greater Harmony"

The above was shared with me by a Native American teacher in high school. He taught a
multiculturalism class that focused significantly on different tribes of North America. He
expressed a particular interest in me at the time due to my [troubled background](/humanity-vs-nature/picher-and-cardin),
the fact that my maternal grandfather is a 100% Sioux Indian, and that I lived in Alaska for
a few years and knew a little about about the tribal history of the area.

He was a rare individual with an extensive and unique perspective on the world.
He was also the only faculty member I knew who stood against the poisonous
"[Safe Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_space)" movement that was being
introduced into the school. He saw it as insulting and insinuating that he was incapable
or unwilling to provide a safe classroom. I never did let my guard down but I
continually work towards embodying my [shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology)).
