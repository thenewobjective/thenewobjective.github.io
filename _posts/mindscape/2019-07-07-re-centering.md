Following my [recent ordeal](/mindscape/2019/06/02/a-shamanic-ordeal.html) I decided to eliminate all chemical dependencies. If I’m to delve into my subconscious again I would like to do so without being influence or pulled in some direction due to something I am unaware of. Alcohol and caffeine have been a staple for years and my tolerance to both are so high that I would have to consume a terrible amount in order to move the needle. This is a clear sign that a heavy finger is on the scale that could be distorting my view of reality.

I am currently finishing my fourth week of detoxing and it has been an ordeal of its own; especially when doing so without chemical assistance. I enjoyed all of the following symptoms:

- Intermittent hand tremors
- Hot flashes
- Cold flashes
- Flushing and minor sweating
- Rapid heart rate
- Unexpected waves of nausea
- Lightheadedness
- Unexpected waves of fatigue
- Anxiousness
- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
- Simultaneous anxiousness and fatigue
- Headaches
- Cold and flu like symptoms
- Inability to concentrate

The tremors subsided within the first couple days and the rest of the symptoms became weaker over time. I made my symptoms worse than they could have been by quitting both alcohol and caffeine simultaneously as they have overlapping effects during withdrawal. I also performed short fasting sprints which gave me a [keto flu](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/keto-flu-symptoms){:target="_blank"}. To top it all off, I tried to shift my sleep schedule back to normal (a 6 hour shift). The fasting and sleep schedule shifting was too much on top of the detox, so I switched from intermittent fasting to caloric restriction and diet change (No refined sugar and no bread/wheat products). I’ll attempt adjusting my sleep schedule again next month. I feel I’m at 90% now and suspect that shortly I will be chemically balanced again and generally improved in overall health.

Enough with the negative though let’s turn to the positive results:

- Weight loss: 195lbs to 185lbs
- A mental fog has been lifted
- Intermittent Cold symptoms are now gone
- I had faint tinnitus which has disappeared
- Improved vision. Before I thought I needed a new prescription, but no longer

Since alcohol [negatively impacts](https://anabolicmen.com/alcohol-testosterone/){:target="_blank"} testosterone, the next steps are restoring those levels as well. An [adjusted diet](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/6989){:target="_blank"} will take care of most of that, and some lesser optimization later.

## Supplements

I’ve always taken a daily multivitamin and about a gram of [Omega-3](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/search?q=Omega-3){:target="_blank"} daily. I’ve recently added a tablespoon of [garlic](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/search?q=Garlic){:target="_blank"} to my regime and will be adding [Sulforaphane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4YVJ4aRfg){:target="_blank"} next week.

## Caveat

If you plan on following in my footsteps, go see a doctor. I’ve only documented my journey and was aware of the risks and accepted them. If my withdrawal symptoms were even slightly worse, I would seen a doctor as well. In the Withdrawal Timeline reference below you can see some of the more extreme risks and I invite you to read it.

## Afterthought

You may have seen the recent news about Angela Merkel’s [violent shaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URUqqNdGXNo){:target="_blank"} during one event, and the less pronounced shaking [later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTdiikDPsHk){:target="_blank"}. Given the [rumors](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3112354/Angela-Merkel-formidable-DRINKER-says-Norwegian-counterpart.html){:target="_blank"} of her stamina, I can’t help but think she might be going through withdrawal as well. If so I wish her luck.
