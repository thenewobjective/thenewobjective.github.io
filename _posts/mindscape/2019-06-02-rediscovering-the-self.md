For about a year or so I have been delving into the works of Carl Jung. I first read about him when I was 16 years old but wasn’t quite sure of what I was reading at the time. Sadly I had only access to indirect works and quotes but nothing direct. Concepts like [The Collective Unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious){:target="_blank"} (as it was described to me then) seemed too much like religious thinking and magic, and at that time in my life I was strongly Atheist. Ironically I was also reading everything I could by Nietzsche, which reinforced much of where my mind was at the time.

Nearly two decades later, through the online content of Jordan Peterson, I rediscovered Carl Jung in detail and was surprised by the powerful connection between Jung and Nietzsche. Naturally I reread all that I owned and more. This sent me down a rabbit hole of psychoanalysis, meditative works of Yogis and Buddhists, Gnosticism, and more. Seeing the world from an orthogonal point of view without discarding anything I already knew from objective materialism was an enlightening realization.

From the middle of 2018 I’ve decided to undertake seriously the practices of meditation and [dream interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_interpretation#Jung){:target="_blank"} through guided control. I also decided to pursue all of this without any help of drugs or hallucinogenics. I’m not certain what my goal is, beyond exploring a significant part of myself and what may indeed be the [Collective Unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious){:target="_blank"} of humanity. I’m focusing on looking for symbols, but hopefully I don’t invent them from my imagination in the process. This will me amateurish without a doubt, but perhaps I’ll discover far more about the [Shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology)){:target="_blank"} of myself and of humanity in the process.
