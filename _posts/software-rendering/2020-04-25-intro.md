There are many tutorials and books dedicated to graphics programming. Many of these books are geared
towards some particular hardware, a particular framework, or assume a certain level of knowlede that
the reader may not possess. There is also the issue of relevance. Some of the greatest graphics books
are outdated and the pearls of wisdom they contain can be challenging to rescue for more modern use.

This particular guide aims to teach 2D and 3D graphics programming from first principles by starting
from plotting a pixel on the screen and then building upon that knowledge to create more sophisticated
functionality.

The goal is to try and remain as timeless as is feasible. This does not mean that the guide has to remain
abstract. This guide will not only present techniques but also demonstrate with code following the current
web standards. Specifically the HTML5 `<canvas>` tag and ECMAScript. The `<canvas>` tag will only be used
for manipulating its underlying pixel data directly and none of its other drawing routines.
