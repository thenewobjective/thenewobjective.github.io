[Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) and [Eweda](https://github.com/CrossEye/eweda) are functional programming libraries for JavaScript developed by [Scott Sauyet](https://twitter.com/scott_sauyet), [G. Lathoud](http://glat.info/transfun/), and others. Before Ramda and in the early days of Eweda there were significant philosophical and architectural discussions between Scott and I. If youâ€™re interested in the prehistory of these libraries you might find these threads enlightening.
