The generation of electrical power has a long history and can be accomplished through a variety of methods.
The most common approach involves moving a loop of wire, copper usually, through the poles of a magnet.
This method can be thought of as being analogous to a pump pushing water through a pipe, yet in this case
the pipe is the wire, and the pump is the magnetic field. The trick comes down to discovering novel ways to
move the wire or magnet while expending as little energy in the process. While many intriguing ways have been
developed to accomplish this feat, it is not the only method. Not all of them are equal in effectiveness nor
in the side-effects they may have on the environment as a result. This article will review the status of some
of the more popular electrical generation techniques and the shortcomings they each suffer. After reviewing these
approaches an improved, viable alternative: Thorium Reactors will be presented which will remedy most of these
issues raised. But to determine the effectiveness of these different approaches, it is necessary to develop
a metric by which to compare them. This ad hoc metric will be based on the feasibility of the method to fulfill
the current and potential power needs of the country, its environmental impact, the initial cost of development,
the maintenance cost, and any special side-effects specific to each, such as collateral land damage or noise
pollution. The power generation techniques to be reviewed are coal plants, wind, hydroelectric, solar, geothermal,
Uranium based nuclear, and finally Thorium based nuclear.

Coal plants generate electricity through the burning of coal whose heat is used to move a turbine. This method of
power generation is currently the most widely used in the country and is due to several factors. First, coal plants
are not a new technology and have been available for over a hundred years[^6]. These plants are relatively cheap to
build and maintain and have no general location requirement to function[^1]. Each ton of coal can be used to generate
2,460 kWh of electricity and a typical plant can process approximately 1.43 million tons of coal per year[^4].
Yet the reliance on coal as a primary power source comes at a high cost outside of the plants themselves. Coal is a
notoriously dirty fuel and when it is burned a significant amount of soot is released into the atmosphere if not
captured immediately in the generation process. This soot, besides covering and darkening whatever surface it
alights upon, is also a carcinogen and is responsible for several diseases and conditions including Black Lung,
pneumonia and asthma. The use of coal not only harms people while polluting the air, but as a limited resource,
will become increasingly difficult to mine due to its growing scarcity. In response, the methods of coal extraction
grow more and more dramatic, so much so in fact that the current approach involves the decapitation of entire
mountains which result in significant levels of heavy metal deposits in water sources as well as displacement of
numerous varieties of animal life[^8].So, while coal power can meet most of our power needs today, its sustainability
at current prices is not reliable[^1]. As the cost of extraction continues to increase along with the demand, and
as resources diminish, an alternative will eventually be needed anyway, not to mention the necessity to find an
alternative which can avoid the negative impact it has on the environment and health.

Wind power has been praised as a great alternative to fossil fuels due to its reduced pollution output because of not
needing to rely on combustion to generate electricity as well as the mining operations that go along with obtaining
that fuel. The method used instead is to utilize the motion of the wind to turn a large electric turbine which is
propped upon a very tall tower and can sometimes approach heights upwards of 650 feet[^9]. A high-end wind turbine
can produce approximately 20 gigawatts at full capacity in a year. While this may seem like a lot of power, in
comparison to the average coal plant this is a paltry 0.6% of what is generally produced, to put it another way,
about 175 wind turbines would need to be built to equate the output of a single coal powered plant[^9]. To make
matters worse, being reliant upon the mood of the weather and the cycles of the climate, these turbines rarely
run at full capacity year-round, hence requiring even more turbines. With an expected installation cost of
approximately $18.2 million per turbine not to mention the cost of the acreage required to carry such a large array,
it’s easy to do the math to see that the clean benefits of a wind power alternative fall flat in the face of
practical considerations[^11].

Like wind power, solar power also suffers from being a slave to weather conditions, even worse it suffers from being
a slave to the latitudes of the planet. Solar power, as the name implies, relies upon the sun to generate electricity.
Generating this eco-friendly electricity is not cheap though since building a facility can cost anywhere from $2.50 to
$4 per watt[^2]. To compete with the average 3.5-terawatt annual output of coal plant, it would be necessary to invest
a staggering amount of money. Also, like wind power, a solar plant requires a significant area of land to operate.
For example, Ontario has an 80mW solar farm that requires 950 acres to operate at 3% of sample coal plant's output[^5].
While the advances in this technology are interesting, it is premature to rely on it as a viable replacement for
the current system.

Hydroelectricity as a power alternative has a better track record than the green methods discussed thus far.
Hydroelectricity functions by using waterfalls or a dam to power electric turbines. Unlike coal plants, hydroelectric
plants do not produce atmospheric pollution due to the lack of need for fossil fuels. Unlike wind and solar power,
it can generate more electricity for a cheaper price. While hydro dams come in a variety of sizes and capacities,
one notable example is the Three Gorges dam in China which generated close to 80TW in 2009 on a budget of $25 billion[^7].
The equivalent output from coal would require approximately 23 plants at a price tag of $18 billion which is
unfortunate but much more comparable in price than the other alternatives listed thus far. Besides costing twice as
much as coal power, another unfortunate downside is that the dams can have a significant impact on the local
environment. The creation of an artificial lake can disrupt the local populations of animals and people. The dam
also alters the flow of water downstream which has a similar displacement effect. So, while not perfect,
hydroelectric power is nearly a viable alternative to coal if not for its reliance upon moving water sources to
function, which are limited to geographic region.

Can nothing steal the crown of productive capacity from coal plants? The power of the atom may hold the key.
Nuclear power plants use the concept of nuclear fission (splitting atoms) to heat water to power an electric
turbine like other methods.  Traditional nuclear power plants based on Uranium can generate an amazing amount of
electricity. The Grand Gulf nuclear reactor located in Mississippi generates approximately 9.4TW of electricity
annually[^10]. This is equivalent to three average coal plants. Unfortunately, the cost of this reactor is a bit
more than the cost of three coal plants with a price tag of $6.3 billion vs the coal plant's cost of $2.3 billion[^10].
lso, with the scarcity of Uranium and the ever-present concern over the creation of weapons, most people are weary
of this technology.  So, what is the alternative? What is an affordable power solution that is not a slave to
the geographic location or resources, produces little or no pollution, does not have a devastating environmental
impact, and can provide for the power needs of today and tomorrow? Surprisingly, it is not some prototype
technology, nor something completely different than what one may be used to. The answer is to switch from a Uranium
focused nuclear plant to a Thorium based one. Thorium, unlike Uranium, is abundant around the world as a nuisance
by-product of heavy metal mining. While radioactive, thorium is harmless enough to handle if not consumed. One ton
of Thorium can be used in a nuclear plant to generate as much electricity as 20 tons of Uranium, and as much
electricity as 3.5 million tons of coal and at only half the cost of a traditional Uranium plant[^3].
With such a large energy bang for the buck, it is hard to imagine why its adoption has not already occurred.
This may be explained partially by the migration cost of having to replace current energy systems with a new one.
Most nuclear plants are decades old and are the traditional Uranium types. While not as safe as their Thorium
counterparts, the fissile material producible by these plants for weapons was in very high demand during the cold
war by both NATO and the Soviet Union[^3]. Even though the cold war is over and a desire to reduce nuclear
stockpiles is in place, it remains cheaper to maintain current aging plants vice spending an initial investment
in building better ones. The government has promised $8 billion in loans for new reactors but budget woes and the
partial meltdown at Three-Mile-Island in 1979 is still lingers in the back of consumer's mind, stereotyping a
perceived danger of nuclear power in general and politicizing the advancement of the technology. Perhaps as the
memory fades, and carbon taxes take a stronger hold with an improving economy, a greater desire by the government
and private utilities to invest money may take place. India along with several European countries are already on
the path to a Thorium based future but for the United States, only time may tell. Making well known a powerful,
clean alternative is the best hope for increasing the desire for its pursuit.
