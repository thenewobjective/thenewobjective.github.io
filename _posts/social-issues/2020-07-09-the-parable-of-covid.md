Once upon a time there was a politician who went to visit his his son and
found that he had COVID.

He went and asked his friend: "Tell me who infected my son so that I can
visit terrible vengeance upon them."

His friend replied: "It was the riots and protests he was in", whereupon 
the politician exclaimed: "Surely, you lie, it was those bars and restaurants!"

Immediately afterward, the politician went out and closed a great many of
bars and restaurants to avenge the infection of his son.
