*Below is a writing from my mother to me about her perspective on the impact of war and PTSD after the
[Gulf War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War)*

In August of 1990 right after I gave birth to your youngest brother, your father was called to serve in the middle east.
It was a very sudden event. We were still in Oklahoma, since I had gone there for the c-section so that my parents could
help me during recovery. We had to go back to Texas much sooner than anticipated. I couldn't believe that they called him
during our medical leave. We had to get a doctor's release to travel sooner than we should have but had no choice.
The Army called, we had to go.

We got back to Texas, packed his things and I had to drop him off the next morning at the airfield in North Ft. Hood.
We had to park behind barricades because family was not permitted beyond that point.We watched him walk away to do a
mission that we were told was called Operation Desert Shield. As it was explained to me... he would be going there for
about three months, then rotate.  We were told that it was just to help the Saudi Arabian government protect their oil fields.

I was given the number to the pentagon and was told that if I did not hear from my husband on a fairly regular basis, to call
and they would send word for his commander to get him to a phone.  I wasn't really scared at the time, seemed like a normal
routine thing.

After about a week, I had not heard from him letting me know that they made it safely.  I called the pentagon, gave them his
information. They assured me that I would hear from him within 24 hours.  I did.  He let me know that he was in place in Saudi
Arabia, but that he was not allowed to tell me where. (Saudi Arabia is a really big place).

I wrote him letters, sent him packages, waited for any news from him for weeks.  The public schools were sending packages to him
as well as other soldiers. I watched more CNN than I care to remember.  Watching in hopes of seeing him on tv so that I could
assure myself that he was still okay.

It was a very hard time for me. Alone in Texas with three very small children. Still trying to recover from the surgery.
My sister suggested that I go and stay with her while he was deployed. I had thought about it and decided that she was probably right.
I packed up our home into storage since we did not know how long it was going to be. I headed with the kids to Oklahoma to see my
parents on my way to Virginia.

While at my parents, I had stopped by to see some friends before heading across the country. It was at this time that I had been visiting
a friend when the news broke that war had been declared. Now Operation Desert Sheild is now being called Desert Storm. My heart skipped
beating for a bit...my chest felt heavy, and I don't think I was breathing for what seemed an eternity.

This routine mission had turned not so routine after all. I couldn't speak. My mind was going over the thought "Oh my God, what do I
do if something happens to him? How will I take care of these three babies on my own?  What do I do?  What am I supposed to do? Do I
call someone?  I don't even know where he is!"  Needless to say, I was very distraught.

After about an hour or so, I was able to compose myself. Got my brain working again. I headed back to my parents for the night and
headed out the next morning to my sisters. I wanted to get there as fast as possible, since my sister was in the Navy and could
possibly give me foresight into what is happening or what may happen.

I drove straight thru from Oklahoma to Virginia Beach. When I arrived, I was exhausted but couldn't sleep. I didn't think I would ever
sleep while he was gone.  I spent 24hrs a day, seven days a week listening to and watching the news.  I would doze off for a few
minutes then jerk right back awake, terrified that I would miss something that was vitally important to the well-being of my family.

I hadn't heard from him in over a month, now feeling terrified I placed another call to the pentagon. Gave them the information and
within 5 hours, received a call from your father.  It was a horrible connection, but manageable. He assured me that I needn't worry.
That he is in a safe place. I asked him where, he told me he was in Riyad. Safe from the fighting in Iraq. I finally got some rest.

The next several months grew increasingly more difficult. With the war going on. the phone calls were less and less.  The news was
getting worse and worse.  Watching explosions, IED's killing soldiers, helicopter crashes, etc.  The news always stating, "the names
are not being released pending notification to the families".  That is the worst feeling you can have...not knowing...waiting for a
knock at the door at any given moment.  All the while trying to re-assure your kids that daddy will be home soon, and not knowing if
you are lying to your children or yourself.

Finally, in March of 1991 I got the best news ever.  He was coming home!  So, at that point, I got some sleep...packed up and headed
back to Texas to find a place to rent.  I got moved into a new place with my three kids just in time for his arrival. I thought
everything was going to be back to normal.  I was wrong.

He came back a different person than when he left.  He was a very shy, quiet caring man when he left.  When he got back, he was distant,
seemingly uncaring, jitterish.  His only want was to drink with his fellow soldiers.

He began telling me of the bodies he had seen.  He had pictures of these things as well.  Slowly over time, he told me things that he
asked me not to ever mention.  I wish he hadn't mentioned them to me.  But at the same time, I am glad that he could talk about it so
that it didn't sit and fester inside him.

They say that war changes a man... that is very true. But. It is not only the man, it changes the dynamics of an entire family structure.
It destroys the soldiers trust in his family. It destroys the trust of the family for the soldier, leaving a family to not know what to
expect if and when an emotional situation arises.

I have been through this twice in my lifetime so far, first with your father, then with you.  It is the hardest emotional rollercoaster
ride a wife and mother has to bear.  Wanting to be there to protect my love ones.  Willing to do anything to be with you. Wanting to
fight right beside you, kill anyone who endangers you so that not one single hair on your head is misplaced but knowing that it is
not possible. I think that is why they never tell the mothers the exact location where their child can be found.

I have heard it said that "War is hell"...I think that the aftermath of war is a much bigger hell.
