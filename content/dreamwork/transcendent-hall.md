## Overview

Intepreting this particular imagery I find very difficut.

First to identify the elements:

- There is an Olympian or Heavenly architecture at play here.
- An archway with a prominent center column.
- A the apex of the archway is a copper circle with a golden triangle inside of it.
   - Within the triange are horizontal engraved lines
- Beyond the archway is the open sky with some clouds.
- Seated at the bottom right is a contemplative figure.
    - He reminds me primarily of [Hermes Trismagistus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus), but also of [Melencolia I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melencolia_I) by Albrecht Durer.

## The Architecture: The Liminal Space

The setting, a marble temple opening up to the vast blue sky, creates a [Liminal Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality)
(a threshold).

It reminds me of Olympus/Heaven. It seems to be a sacred, protected space.

I am looking out through the arch, suggesting a transition from the "known" into the "unknown".

There is a feeling of "height" signifying maybe an ascension of consciousness.

## The Hermes Figure

Hermes is a [psychopomp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopomp), a guide of souls who can travel between the Upper World (consciousness) and the Underworld (the unconscious).
His presence signifies perhaps that I am currently at a "threshold" state, standing between two realities.

Hermes is usually depicted in his young form, but here he appears older, more contemplative; Mercurius Senex (The Old Mercury). This represents the integration of wisdom.

If he is a guide, but is sitting in contemplation,
it seems to double down on the liminal nature of this moment.
An archway is a threshold, and the guide is not guiding, so he must be waiting for me to make the next move.

## The Central Column: The Axis Mundi

From a Jungian perspective, this pillar might represent the [Axis Mundi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_mundi).

It has a central position and supports the archway.

Notice how this pillar stands directly beneath the Golden Triangle. It creates a vertical line of connection.

## The Golden Triangle: The Transcendent Function

The golden triangle at the "keystone" position of the arch is a powerful symbol.

My first thought was that this represents [The Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity),
but perhaps it is instead a symbol representing the [Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_in_Jungian_psychology);
the organizing principle of the psyche.

Being a triangle, according to Jung, it represents a [transcendent function](https://eternalisedofficial.com/2024/01/11/the-psychology-of-numbers/#3-numbers-as-the-archetype-of-wholeness-self-),
a resolution of conflict and the emergence of wholeness.

Being golden, and sitting at the apex of the arch, it might act as a guiding beacon or a [target of aspiration (Rubedo)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubedo).

## Interpretation

I think this dream imagery paints a picture of "The Pause Before the Crossing".
If I have reached a point of high psychological development or insight,
then the "flighty" energy of my intuition is maturing into wisdom. The message of the image
being one of active contemplation.

The guide is not leading me by the hand; he is sitting, waiting for me to understand the
significance of the moment.

I conclude it is a call to stop "doing" and start "being" to integrate the wisdom I've
gathered before moving forward.
