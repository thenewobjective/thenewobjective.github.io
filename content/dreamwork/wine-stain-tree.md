From a Jungian perspective, this seems to be a form of Mandala given the circular shape
and the presence of a tree in the center.

The tree, being dead, could symbolize a number of things.
It might represent the end of a cycle or phase in life, suggesting that something has
come to an end. Perhaps psychic exhaustion, a transition into dormancy or a period of
introspection.

Being embodied in a wine stain, it could also symbolize
something sacrificial or transformative fluid (blood analog).
A stain implies something that has already occurred and cannot be undone.

Thus, a wine stain forming the tree suggests that the "dead" psychic structure is not inert;
it is suffused with instinctual or emotional content. Something has died, but it died
through emotional experience rather than sterile decay.

So the question for myself must be:

what is it in my life that now feels finished, yet still structurally present
and emotionally saturated?
