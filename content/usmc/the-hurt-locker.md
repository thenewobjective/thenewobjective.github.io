*The Hurt Locker* is a 2008 war film directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by Mark Boal[^1]. It is a movie about the
exploits of an EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) squad during the early years of the campaign Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Mark Boal wrote the film to tell a fictional story as realistic as possible that: "was trying to show the logistical
futility of the war […] that will hopefully be around for a while and will help people learn about this war"[^2].
If this statement seems somewhat ambiguous on the fictional or non-fictional intent of the film, then the reader is
not alone. How much the movie depicts fictional people and events has been an issue of debate. Master Sergeant Jeffrey
S. Sarver claims that his likeness and experiences were misappropriated and exaggerated by Mark Boal when he was embedded
as a journalist with his team[^3]. This film has been the subject of a rare critical response which is divided on a hard
line. This division is mainly between Veterans and War correspondents, being against the film due to its exaggerations
and inaccuracies, and the general public which see it as either an entertaining film or an excellent portrayal of what it
might be like to experience the Iraq War. Whether the intent of the writer was to create a fictional or a non-fiction piece,
the popularity of the film and its responses raise the question of how it shapes the understanding of this conflict and
whether it does so in a productive manner.

Before the critical responses to *The Hurt Locker* can be evaluated it is prudent to give a quick plot summary of the movie.
As mentioned earlier, the movie focuses on the exploits of an EOD team during the beginning of the Second Iraq War, consisting
of Sergeant Sanborn, Specialist Eldridge, and Staff Sergeant William James played respectively by: Anthony Mackie, Brian
Geraghty, and Jeremy Renner. The film begins with Sgt Sanborn, Spc. Eldridge, and a SSgt. Thompson as squad leader attempting
to disarm an explosive device with a robot. Technical difficulties lead to SSgt. Thompson attempting to disarm the bomb manually
which leads to his death. This event leads to the introduction of SSgt James as the new squad leader who turns out to be a
reckless maverick. The squad's first mission is to disarm a reported IED near an Army platoon. SSgt James proceeds to approach
the reported area and while his fellow soldiers provide him cover. He then uses a smoke grenade to conceal himself to the
irritation of his comrades, but presumably to the dismay of snipers as well. He also refuses to communicate his position as well
as anything he does while defusing not one, but seven explosives. Their second mission is to disarm a car bomb outside of a U.N.
Building which has caught fire. SSgt James again takes the lead to find and disarm the bomb while his fellows provide cover. After
removing his protective suit and dousing the flames, he begins his lengthy search through the vehicle for the triggering device while
the local populace starts to congregate. After successfully disarming the car-bomb, a Colonel arrive to congratulate him and ask
questions about his gung-ho attitude and accomplishments of which he is impressed. During some down-time, SSgt James meets a local
boy who sells bootlegged movies at the base and meets up with the rest of his team to detonate some explosives they've gathered.
During this event, Sgt Sanborn mentions to Spc. Eldridge the ease at which they could kill SSgt James in an explosion and make it
look like an accident, presumably due to his irritation at SSgt. James's attitude. Sometime later, the squad comes across some
mercenaries in the desert who've captured some valuable prisoners and are having trouble with their vehicle. Both the mercenaries
and the EOD squad are then attacked by a sniper team which successfully kills all the mercenaries. The EOD squad kills all the
attackers though leading to a stronger bond in the team. After some more downtime, an Army Counselor expresses his intent to
accompany the team on their next mission to get closer to Spc. Eldridge, who is suffering from depression. As the team continues
their mission to investigate a building of supposed bomb-makers, they discover a stockpile of explosives as well as the body of a
boy appearing to be the DVD seller from the base. SSgt James leaves the area with the body of the boy and returns to the base, but
not after the counselor is killed in another explosion. He then proceeds to verbally assault the boss of the salesman boy and
holds him at gunpoint in his car and demands he drives to the boy's house. After discovering he was taken to the wrong house, he
returns to the base on foot. Later he and his team are called to the scene of a large tanker explosion. SSgt James then gets
agitated and runs off into the city with his team to look for the perpetrator. They split up to search and rejoin after they hear
gun shots only to see Spc. Eldridge being kidnapped by insurgents. After rescuing him, and injuring him in the process, they return
to the base. Spc. Eldridge is later evacuated by helicopter and curses SSgt. James for his actions and attitude. The final mission
of their rotation is to respond to a man wearing a suicide vest in the middle of an empty plaza. After some time speaking with him
over a loudspeaker and talking with a local militiaman, it is discovered he is not an insurgent. SSgt James proceeds to attempt to
remove the vest. He discovers that he doesn't have time to remove the vest which is bolted to the man and runs off as the man
explodes. SSgt. James then returns home to his family but feels out of place and restless. He is indifferent to his wife and daily
life and only cares for his son. The film ends with him returning to the military with a new Company on a new year long rotation
in Iraq[^1].

*The Hurt Locker* was critically acclaimed by most viewers as an epic film depicting the realities of the Iraq war. According to
Rotten Tomatoes, which is perhaps the most well-known online aggregator of movie reviews, 97% of critics gave a thumbs up to the
film including Roger Ebert, "The Hurt Locker is a spellbinding war film by Kathryn Bigelow, a master of stories about men and
women who choose to be in physical danger." and  Richard Roeper, "One of the best movies of the year, with a star-making
performance from Jeremy Renner" [^5]. Most audience reviews were also very positive, with an 83% rating in fact. When viewing
the comments by the audience they generally echo the words of the critics as well as proclaiming how much they enjoyed the
accuracy and depiction of the war and the soldiers. As expected, many especially liked the focus on action itself more than
the details of the characters and personalities. Specific moments in the film weren't generally commented upon as much as
general overviews of the intensity of the presentation[^5]. SSgt James's actions weren't generally viewed negatively and
probably assumed to be normal behavior for a soldier or not too far from it. From the consensus, it is safe to assume that
some of the deeper messages were overlooked without truly understanding. For example, when SSgt James returned home after his
rotation and is attempting to shop for groceries, he stands in the aisle unable to decide what to purchase. He also has a lack
of affection for his wife. These actions may be viewed to be a result of PTSD or a result of his desire for war, or even due to
the life and death decisions he used to make all the time. The truth is more subtle though. His actions and attitude in civilian
life are more of a depiction of how he is institutionalized, like the way long time prisoners are when they are released.
Perspective on the world is significantly altered, and the only thing that makes sense, and feels right is returning to that
environment, James returning to Iraq and the military, and prisoners many times returning to prison.

Negative reviews of *The Hurt Locker* primarily seem to come from veterans and people with military family members.
The single recurring theme in these negative reviews are about the inaccuracy of the film and its depiction of soldiers which is
seen as exaggerated and harmful to people who are ignorant. "That guy was more of a run and gun cowboy type, and that is exactly
the kind of person that we're not looking for" says Tech. Sgt. Jeremy Phillips. "Our team leaders don't have that kind of invincibility
complex, and if they do, they aren't allowed to operate.", says Airman first class Stephen Dobbins[^4].

What is interesting to note is that numerous other war films didn't suffer from such a harsh divide in criticism.
The 1999 George Clooney film *Three Kings* for example wasn't criticized harshly for its gross inaccuracies and exaggerations but
instead for being a rehashed story. What makes the reviews of a movie of fiction like this different from a movie of fiction like
*The Hurt Locker*? Ambiguous intent, or perhaps, not so ambiguous intent.  Mark Boal said in his interview with *New York Magazine*,
"I actually think every war movie is an antiwar movie in its own way" and as mentioned earlier he "was trying to show the logistical
futility of the war […] that will hopefully be around for a while, and will help people learn about this war.". Whether the film was
intended to be fictional or not, the question is still separate from whether it was intended to be a propaganda film. Viewers and
critics saw the movie not only as fiction, but also as a simulation and as an exaggerated documentary, which was the intent of Mark Boal.
*Three Kings*, in contrast, was a less in-depth simulation but not trying to be a documentary. Viewers and critics of Boal's film picked
up on this consciously or otherwise and this led to the types of responses seen.

With people's easy access to the Internet, films trying to take the on the role of propaganda through simulation and fiction the way
*The Hurt Locker* has are not as effective as they might otherwise be. The ability to easily see what other people are thinking, and the
perspectives they bring to critical reviews, as well as the access to those with genuine experience can protect the unwitting audience
from modern and traditional media which might aim to change the worldview of its consumers. *The Hurt Locker's* portrayal of the war can't
be viewed simply through black-and-white lens of being productive or otherwise. The multitude of audience and critical reviews as well as
instant access to commentary by the creators of the film provide key insights into not only things that the movie does well, but also as
an excellent starting point, through audience reviews to other ideas which can shape understanding of the conflict in positive ways.
