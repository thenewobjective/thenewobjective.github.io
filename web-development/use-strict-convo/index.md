*Below is a reposting of a twitter conversation on the topic of “use strict”. Given the ephemeral nature of twitter, I think it’s important to keep a copy of my participation before the context is lost. The thread has been edited slightly for presentation and hateful spammer participants have been removed.*

> The point of evolving the language is to not have to worry about such "habits"

&mdash; Michael Haufe @mlhaufe &middot; Aug 25, 2016
