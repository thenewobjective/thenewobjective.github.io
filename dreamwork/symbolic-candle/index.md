Through the active trial and error of symbolic dreaming ([see previously](/dreamwork/rediscovering-the-self/)),
I’ve come across some interesting images. I’m not certain of how to categorize them nor which to ignore so I’ve
been focusing on things unexpected: objects and images I couldn’t create in a fully conscious imagination which
seem important. This seems very subjective and arbitrary, but it’s a start.

Recently the image I came across is a candle with an upside down flame. Here is a reproduction:

Is there a historic meaning to such a symbol? A cursory glance yields nothing for me.
