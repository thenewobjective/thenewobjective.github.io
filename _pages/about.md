## About me

![Profile Image](/images/profile/top-hat-justice.jpg){:class="about-me_profile"}

I am a USMC war veteran and Systems Engineer with a formal education in Computer Science (Programming Language Theory).
Iâ€™ve been programming in some form since 1996 (IBM 386).

I am highly [conscientious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q15eTySnWxc) and moderately
[open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I) according to the [Five Factor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits).
Duty, order, and formalism are the lenses I see the world through.

## About the site

This is my personal website. It contains a variety of content without a common theme,
though primarily it functions as a form of [self-authoring](https://youtu.be/qa9u5t3C0AI),
as a journal of musings on a variety of topics, and a nexus for my activities across the web.

The site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a custom theme and hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/thenewobjective/thenewobjective.github.io).

This site is unaffiliated with [New Objective, Inc.](http://www.newobjective.com/). The names are coincidental.
