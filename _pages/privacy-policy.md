## Plain English

This is my personal site, and I donâ€™t care who you are specifically unless you comment on something or engage in abuse of this website.

## Comments

Comments are managed by GitHub and loaded programmatically for display. You can view their privacy policy [on their website](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement){:target="_blank"}.

## Cookies

No cookies are explicitly set or read by this website directly. Third party embedded content may set cookies of their own.

## Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

Currently only github has first-party access to do so. Other third-party content is restricted via iframe sandboxing and/or Content Security Policies.

## Analytics

No analytics are being collected currently.

## Who I share your data with

No one knowingly. A third party resource may abuse its privilege. If you identify something sharing your data contact me and I will eliminate this resource and update the website's security policy as necessary.

## How long I retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely via GitHub. No other data is collected.

## What rights you have over your data

If you have left comments on one or more posts, you can fully manage these comments on the repective issue thread linked to from the post.

## Abuse

In the unlikely event that you abuse this website your IP address and/or other PII may be collected for blocking future access.
