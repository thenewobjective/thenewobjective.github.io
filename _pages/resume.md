                Managing the Evolution of Software Product Lines<br>
                Description of an approach that is capable of versioning multiple types of Product Line projects.
                It has a versioning model for a product line consisting of a single core assets project and multiple product projects where
                core assets are shared among the products through the use of shared components. Using the shared component data structure and
                the branching of the core assets project, we are able to support independent development of core assets and products and change
                propagation between them.

    After my separation from the military I lived for a short period at the Park East Hotel. The owner was looking to relaunch his club and was in need of some extra hands to manage the crowd. After hearing of my experience from a number of earlier conversations, he offered a temporary position checking legal age and managing intoxicated/aggressive patrons. This lounge is now called Club Aura.

        Before being Honorably Discharged I was employed by the USMC as a Supply Administration Clerk, and later a Supply Administration Chief of Sergeant rank. My responsibilities included the submission & receipt of requisitions/purchases, and subsequent record keeping. I also performed proper disposal procedures of sensitive equipment and materials. I’ve been responsible for managing periodic inventories of multi-million dollar materials. The Product Information Management system (PIM) primarily utilized was referred to as: ATLASS/SASSY (Asset Tracking Logistics and Supply System/Supported Activities Supply System). O*NET mapping

        From 2006-2007 I was deployed to Fallujah, Iraq where I was solely responsible for the submission and tracking of high priority supplies and equipment in an undermanned, fast paced and stressful environment. I developed a number of applications to assist me in many of these ventures and boost productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
        The applications developed were data management programs designed to interface with legacy 3270 terminal and DOS systems as well as automate Microsoft Office Applications. These were developed primarily in JScript, VBScript, VBA and JSP.
