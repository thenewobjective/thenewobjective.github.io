### Generative AI and Critical Thinking

Generative AI and Critical Thinking

A study conducted by Microsoft Research surveyed 319 knowledge workers who use generative AI (GenAI) tools at work at least once per week to understand the impact of these tools on critical thinking, cognitive effort, and confidence. The study found that higher usage of GenAI tools is associated with reduced critical thinking, defined as the ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information to make reasoned decisions.

When using GenAI tools, the effort invested in critical thinking shifts from information gathering to information verification, from problem-solving to AI response integration, and from task execution to task stewardship.
This shift indicates that while GenAI tools can improve worker efficiency, they can also inhibit critical engagement with work and potentially lead to long-term overreliance on the tool and diminished skill for independent problem-solving.

The study also revealed that higher confidence in GenAI's ability to perform a task is related to less critical thinking effort. For instance, confidence in GenAI was negatively correlated with perceived enaction of critical thinking, suggesting that as workers become more confident in GenAI, they perceive less need for critical thinking.

Participants in the survey reported that they engage in critical thinking primarily to ensure the quality of their work, such as by verifying outputs against external sources.
The study identified several barriers to critical thinking when using GenAI tools, including awareness barriers, motivation barriers, and ability barriers.

In summary, while GenAI tools can enhance efficiency, they may also reduce the perceived need for critical thinking among knowledge workers, potentially leading to overreliance on these tools and diminished independent problem-solving skills.

### Spell Checkers

    The influence of spell checkers on student's ability to generate repairs of spelling errors

    A study conducted by Hazelynn Rimbar investigated the influence of spell-checkers on students' ability to generate repairs of spelling errors. The research involved 30 Form 1 students in Kuching, Sarawak, who were given dictations containing commonly misspelled words according to Oxford University Press (2012).
    The experimental group was given three dictations, one of which allowed the use of word processors with spell-checker tools, while the control group was given two handwritten dictations. The data were analyzed using statistical software, and the findings indicated that while spell-checkers helped learners revise their spelling on one dictation exercise, learners still made the same errors in their spelling after using spell-checkers.
    This suggests that spell-checkers help eliminate surface errors but have very little influence on correcting errors on the cognitive level.

@headinthebox
I have said it many times before, and you all told me that I was crazy, but I'll say it again: ***The golden age of SWE is over***.

@headinthebox
Here is a more down-to-earth way to think about the effect of AI on coding. I'm sure all the farmhands in the early 1900s argued that a combine harvester couldn't possibly do the job as well as they could by hand. And yet, here we are.

@Gilad_Bracha
I tend to agree. We might ask if Jevon's paradox will create so much software that requires humans to oversee/verify that SE employment remains intact. I doubt it, but it is possible.

@mlhaufe
GUIs didn't replace the CLI, and WYSIWYGs haven't replaced the implementation of UIs despite decades of existence. Even with commodity software we suffer under it. So I'm suspicious of LLMs successfully eating commodity software as well.

@mlhaufe
Lowering the barrier to entry for new software and being a low-pass filter for brainstorming is no small feat of course. As you said: a dialogue of development. The caveat I see is that you would not be programming against your domain, but programming against an implied one

@mlhaufe
I recall the story of Norvig vs Ron Jeffries implementing Sudoku:

<https://web.archive.org/web/20220209031932/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3033446>

I can't help but think we'll see analogous problems with "vibe coded" solutions

@Gilad_Bracha
Again, I want to distinguish between current situation and where it's moving to. Vibe-coding is problematic: The AI isn't up to it,  the people who use it naively trust it etc.  It's like writing software w/o testing. Socratic dialog with a card shark.

@mlhaufe
The sense that I'm getting is that we're asymptoting in LLM competence (A stream can't rise above its source).
As a result, LLM oriented programming rhymes with "scripting" that is glue for 3rd party tools written in traditional deterministic languages.

@mlhaufe
I'm interested in knowing what that balance will be.

Semi-rhetorical question: Will  the LLM just perform NLP + tool search for application?

How does the Smalltalk tradition think about this?

(This is an idle thought; I'm not expecting a reply, especially in a tweet...)

@DataSciFact
Depending on which part of the logistic curve you look at, it can be growing exponentially, growing linearly, or exponentially approaching an plateau.

"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it." - Kernighan

For non-commodity software the LLMs aren't good enough to even write it
