![The Convergence of Truth](/media-library/uncategorized/convergence-truth.png)

## Introduction

During an episode of [The Dark Horse Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@DarkHorsePod), Bret Weinstein made an off-hand comment
along the lines of *"All truths that rise must eventually converge"*. This phrase reminded me of a similar line of thought
I was exploring in the context of GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems. The idea that there is one ultimate truth that all other
truths converge towards. This article is an exploration of that idea and its implications.

The phrase *"All truths that rise must eventually converge"* seems to be a variation of a quote by
[Pierre Teilhard De Chardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin):

> Remain true to yourself, but move ever upward toward greater consciousness and greater love!
> At the summit you will find yourselves united with all those who, from every direction, have
> made the same ascent. For everything that rises must converge.

&mdash; Pierre Teilhard De Chardin

## What is truth?

> Philosophy only exists due to the confusion of meaning caused when the same word is used to mean
> different things in more than one [language-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy))

&mdash; [Keean Schupken](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4955#comment-80215)

"Truth" is a word that is pregnant with meaning. Before we can explore theveracity of the convergence of "truth", we must first
agree on its definition.
