<!-- BRAVE
All Truths Converge Eventually
The phrase "all truths that arise must eventually converge" seems to be a variation of the title
"Everything That Rises Must Converge," which is a collection of short stories by Flannery O'Connor.
The original title is derived from the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who wrote, "Remain true
to yourself, but move ever upward toward greater consciousness and greater love! At the summit you
will find yourselves united with all those who, from every direction, have made the same ascent.
For everything that rises must converge."

In the context of Flannery O'Connor's work, the phrase suggests that all aspects of life, including
different social classes, races, and religions, will eventually intersect or converge. This convergence
can either result in a disastrous collision or a peaceful merging, depending on the attitudes and
actions of the individuals involved.

The concept of convergence in O'Connor's stories often relates to the idea that all characters,
regardless of their backgrounds or beliefs, will face a moment of truth or a confrontation with their
own flaws and prejudices. This moment can lead to a realization or a change in perspective, reflecting
a broader theme of sin and repentance in her work.
