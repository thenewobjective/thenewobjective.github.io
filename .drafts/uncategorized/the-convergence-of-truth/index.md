<!-- ![The Convergence of Truth](/media-library/uncategorized/convergence-truth.png) -->

## Introduction

During an episode of [The Dark Horse Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@DarkHorsePod), Bret Weinstein made an off-hand comment
along the lines of *"All truths that rise must eventually converge"*. This phrase reminded me of a similar line of thought
I was exploring in the context of Gödel's incompleteness theorems. The idea that there is one ultimate truth that all others
will converge towards. This article is an exploration of that idea and its implications.

The phrase *"All truths that rise must eventually converge"* seems to be a variation of a quote by
[Pierre Teilhard De Chardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin):

> Remain true to yourself, but move ever upward toward greater consciousness and greater love!
> At the summit you will find yourselves united with all those who, from every direction, have
> made the same ascent. For everything that rises must converge.

## Monism

Belief in the convergence of truth is a form of [Monism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism). Monism is the view that there
is only one fundamental kind of thing or principle. The most common form of monism is [materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism),
which holds that everything is composed of matter. In another extreme, [idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism) holds that
everything is composed of ideas.

Analogously, there are a number of programming languages that are monistic in nature where everything is of one kind:

| Language | Everything is a... |
|----------|--------|
| [Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)) | Object |
| [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) | List |
| [Lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) | Function |
| [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file) | File |
| [SNOBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNOBOL) | String |

Belief in the convergence of truth is a form of monism because it posits that there is only one ultimate truth that all others
are subordinate to.

## What is truth?

> Philosophy only exists due to the confusion of meaning caused when the same word is used to mean
> different things in more than one [language-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy))

&mdash; [Keean Schupken](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4955#comment-80215)

"Truth" is a word that is pregnant with meaning. Before we can explore the veracity of the claim, we must first
agree on its definition. There is a branch of philosophy called [Epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology)
that deals with the nature of knowledge, belief, and truth. [...]
