96 ppi assumption
	text designed to fit on a small screen would not scale
	when screen is larger and when dpi is larger
	text may scale but the window will not?

	MDN reference on how big a pixel is
	how big is 12pt?

	look at the impact of retina

	notice how office is mostly resolution independent.

	what is the impact of zoomig going to be?

	due to biology of human eye fot size
	must be between 9pt and 14pt?
		there is a distance assumption here
		readability improves from 9pt to 12pt then worsens beyond
	is a 1pt = 1/72 of an inch?
		so 1px = ?

	pixel is a relative measurement

	on the web the resolution and ppi varies
	is it a TV with you sitting on the couch?
	is it a phone 6 inches from your nose?
		horizontal or vertical?

	foldable screen?

	pixel dimensions vs screen dimensions

	size of screen vs size of window

	is overflow evil?

	subpixel font?
		aside
			font rasterization algorithms and jaggedness
			TrueType font
			drop-out control

	the person who coined the phrase: "information wants to be free"
	runs the largest patent group?

	The print world is not just a convention, it's also about how
	the eye works. 550+ years of evolution since Gutenberg?

	no scrolling. Paginated only. Fill all space

	Cambria font

	in multicolumn layout font baselines are the same
		the challenge is to maintain it even with extra
		spacing and multiple font sizes in the columns
			(quotes, headings and related margins)
		To accomplish it, the headings and such have to be
		a multiple of the line height

	user needs to increase font size but what of the impact
	to layout?

	we fixate on a target 5-7 characters wide

	Fovea is 1 1/2 degrees of arc

	when reading you don't want the menu bars and such. You want it to
	go away

	Scrolling is the worst thing you can do to someone who
	is trying to read.

	Things in real life don't scroll while you read.
	you want to read the area and then change completely

	scrolling is less comfortable for people to read.
	There is research?

	you want to eliminate "doubling" or reading the same line twice
	When you scroll you read some of the same lines twice
	just to find out where you are

	page turn should be quick (but not instantaneous?)
	prefer paging to scrolling
