"""
The Natural Language interface has lowered the bar so much that we've effectively automated Type-1 thinking, so much so that we've effectively democratized "programming", and hopefully made commodity code and such effectively zero cost for users. But I think we're going to pay a heavy penalty as well. To quote Djikstra:"It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration".Dijkstra's point is not just that BASIC was a "bad" language, but that languages shape mental habits, and bad ones entrench poor habits. In this sense, programming languages are like cognitive prosthetics:
A good prosthetic extends your reach and strengthens your agency, A bad one deforms your movement and locks you into maladaptive patterns.So with Vibe Coding: what is it's proper place? I'd say for prototyping, for domain experts, or for exploration.But if we treat it as a dominant mode of programming, it leads to: fragile, poorly understood black boxes with no formal model of understanding.I want programming to be treated as an [Extended Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_mind_thesis),  where we become more than we are
I don't want it to become a [Contracted Intellect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCPhbN1l024) where dependency replaces mastery.
