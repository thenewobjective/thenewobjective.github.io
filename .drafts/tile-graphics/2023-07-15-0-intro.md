Tile-based graphics were a popular way to render 2D games in the 80s and 90s.
They are still used today despite the advent of 3D graphics due to their simplicity, efficiency,
and nostalgic appeal. I am also guilty of having soft spot for them, and have
created a few tile-based games myself in the late 90s. These games have long since bit-rotted.
I have decided to revisit this topic and create a series of posts detailing the creation of a
tile-based game engine from scratch.

While the target platform for this engine is the web, the techniques used here are applicable
to any platform that supports 2D graphics. The engine will be written in TypeScript and follow
the [Clean Architecture](https://crosp.net/blog/software-architecture/clean-architecture-part-1-databse-vs-domain/)
philosophy. An impressionistic overview of Clean Architecture:

If you've ever read another tutorial on graphics or game programming, you've probably
encountered an approach that falls into one of two categories:

1. It starts bottom up, with the graphics API, and works its way up to the game logic.
2. It starts top down, with an existing game engine or framework and then explains how
it works via reverse engineering (I'm looking at you
[Action Arcade Adventure Set](https://archive.org/details/action-arcade-adventure-set))

I find both of these approaches to be unsatisfying. The first approach is too
low-level and driven by tactical decisions that result in a design that is
hard to replicate on other platforms and APIs. The second approach is too high-level
and like magic you have a game that runs on a screen, but you don't know the thought
processes that actualized it; like Athena, springing forth fully formed from the
head of Zeus ([ref](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/484770347364029322/)).

In this guide, I will take a middle-out approach in "vertical slices" that
incrementally build up the engine from the domain and use-cases to the display.
These slices will be small enough to be easily digestible, but large enough
to be meaningful. Additional functionality will be added incrementally
and organically as the need arises.

I'm assuming you have a basic understanding of programming and have at least
a vague idea of what Tile-based graphics are.

The current web ecosystem
[is a mess](https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/).
There are a plethora of build tools, frameworks, and libraries that are
constantly changing. To avoid the distraction of walking through the setup
of an initial project, the lessons will start in the context of a basic
webpack+TypeScript one that I have [already created](https://github.com/mlhaufe/tile-engine/tree/v0.0.0).
Without much effort, you should be able to clone or create your own empty
project in your chosen language and build system and follow along.
