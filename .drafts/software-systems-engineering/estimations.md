with story points
	how do you know you're increasing productivity?
	just the number?
	vs misestimation?
	higher velocity does not meet sn increase in operational tempo

	Not a measure of progress?

Agreed could = not necessarily
Velocity went up. Does that mean the team is more productive? Maybe.
Could also be the team is estimating bigger because they're nervous about
the risk and are over-estimating but still completing. Could also mean
that they pulled in many smaller stories that they knocked out quickly
versus fewer larger stories. Could also mean they hit a bunch of work
that happened to have been better designed in the past and required less
refactoring than their typical stories. Could also be… could also be… could also be…

""Scrum "Velocity" abused by""
	- Comparing across teams
	- Targeting a particular velocity
	- Targeting a change in velocity
	- Attempting to influence velocity
	- correlating velocity to time
	- using velocity as the measure of progress

"Proper uses of velocity"
	- Development Team uses it as a gauge of how much work to select for a sprint
	- Product Owner uses it to produce a forecast for release Planning, taking
	  into account the cone of uncertainty
