## Introduction

From time-to-time I engage in consulting work. Recently during a discovery session I was
hit with a heavy sense of [déjà vu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu). As the
client was answering one of my questions, I knew exactly what they were going to say word-for-word
for the next few sentences. I also came to the realization that I had dreamt this exact moment
only a week prior. This sense of déjà vu was in this case a memory of the future.

The dream itself was not particularly memorable or unexpected. I was anticipating
the upcoming consulting work, so it was on my mind. It was also not particularly vivid or
detailed. It was simply a dream of me sitting and moving about a room with a handful
of people I didn't recognize. The room was also unfamiliar. There were some conversations
occurring, and I was asking questions. I would have forgotten the dream entirely if it
was more than just a week prior. It wasn't a vague dream, so the details weren't fuzzy,
it was just unremarkable.

## Anecdotes

I am not the first to have experienced this phenomenon, and it apparently has a more specific
name: `Déjà rêvé` or `already dreamed`. There is a Reddit
[thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DejaReve/comments/zm12nn/does_anyone_else_suffer_from_deja_reve/)
with some anecdotes. A more famous account is described by [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung):

    <summary>The mountain climber</summary>

> Among many cases of this sort, I have been especially impressed with one that concerned
> a colleague of mine in Zürich. He was a man somewhat older than myself whom I saw from
> time to time, and who always teased me on these occasions about my interest in
> dream-interpretation. I met him one day in the street, and he called out to me:
> “How are things going? Are you still interpreting dreams? By the way, I’ve had another
> idiotic dream. Does it mean something too?” He had dreamed as follows: “I am climbing a
> high mountain over steep, snow-covered slopes. I mount higher and higher — it is marvellous
> weather. The higher I climb, the better I feel. I think: ‘If only I could go on climbing
> like this for ever!’ When I reach the summit, my happiness and elation are so strong that
> I feel I could mount right up into space. And I discover that I actually can do this. I go
> on climbing on empty air. I awake in a real ecstasy.” When he had told me his dream, I said:
> “My dear man, I know you can’t give up mountaineering, but let me implore you not to go
> alone from now on. When you go, take two guides, and you must promise on your word of
> honour to follow their directions’.” “Incorrigible!” he replied laughing, and said good-bye.
> I never saw him again. Two months later came the first blow. When out alone, he was buried
> by an avalanche, but was dug out in the nick of time by a military patrol which happened to
> came along. Three months after this the end came. He went on a climb accompanied by a younger
> friend, but without guides. An alpinist standing below saw him literally step out into the
> air as he was letting himself down a rock wall. He fell on to the head of his friend, who
> was waiting beneath him, and both were dashed to pieces far below. That was an ecstasis in
> the full meaning of the word.

There is also a blending of such predictive dreams with the concept of [Synchronicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity).
Jung has another excellent collection of anecdotes [here](https://carljungdepthpsychologysite.blog/2020/06/01/the-hereafter/)
and in his book [Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity_(book)).

## Speculations

How can such a thing be possible? Given the untold number of anecdotes it's a real phenomenon,
and the plural of anecdote is evidence but evidence of what?
