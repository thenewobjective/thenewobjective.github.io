In order to predict the future of nature, or more accurately, humanity’s future relationship with nature, it would
be prudent to focus on a single aspect and use that as a lens through which proper judgments can be made in the
proper context. The lens that will be chosen is that of the eating habits of western society. While this choice
may seem to be a strange one, the fundamental necessity of people to eat, and the demands this makes upon the
environment is a significant relationship that cannot be overlooked. Eating is not only a necessity though; it
also serves a social role which is ingrained in human culture. This role, and its evolution over time reflects
how people interact with one another but also to what degree they interact with the world outside their city
walls. It extends beyond mere necessity and like colored glass, shades the world in a way that causes them to
view nature in a different light. Nutrition is one of these colors and is an apt topic in which to focus.

Nutritionism is a popular trend in the western world, especially in the United States, and is a glaring instance
of one the most significant current relationships people have with food and through it, nature. Nutritionism is
the belief that the foods people eat should be defined and evaluated only by their individual ingredients and
quantities, not by their particular combination let alone what particular food item contains them.
[Michael Pollan](https://michaelpollan.com/books/in-defense-of-food/) believes that nutritionism
is a pseudo-religion that requires a priest-like class of experts to interpret and disseminate knowledge about the
foods society chooses to eat. But unlike the traditional priests of religion who seek to gain understanding through
a perspective and interpretation of what they study, food scientists often wear blinders in order to become experts
on narrower and narrower sub-topics within their field. This specialization produces islands of facts fragmented from
one another and enveloped by esoteric terminology that often does not provide wisdom or understanding to the layperson.
With this ignorance and/or misunderstanding, the layperson then ventures forth with the best intentions but oftentimes
on the wrong path to their well-being. The human knowledge of food has become too vast for a human mind to hold while
giving it any meaning. Facts replace wisdom and knowledge usurps understanding. For instance, the average American knows
that [HFCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-fructose_corn_syrup) is bad but at the same time can’t
find out how to eat a healthy diet that results in weight-loss. Hence the current trend of so-called healthy eating but
at the same time increasing rates of obesity and weight related health conditions. This is also coupled with the
commoditization of food. Unlike in times past, food is very easy to come by and little effort is spent to obtain or prepare it.

With food being easy to come by, little thought is placed into how and where it is obtained. What was once a central aspect of
western society and its relationship with nature is now kept at an arms distance as a minor aspect of daily life. Interacting
with the wild world on a daily basis is no longer a necessity for survival and as a result no longer weighs upon the mind. This
pushes nature into the realm of irrelevance, and with the expected increase in scientific advancements in the future regarding
food it can be predicted with confidence that this trend with continue. This trend though is not necessarily a positive one for
all parties involved. As the irrelevance of nature to the common person continues, so will the irrelevance to what negative results
impact nature. The commoditization of food has led to specialization in the types and ingredients by which it is made. This promotes
the success of certain plants and animals over others. The chosen ones then compete for and dominate the natural resources that other
plants and animals would have used, putting them at existential risk. While science is responsible for making this possible, it is not
to blame for its means of integration into the western world. people demand readily available food for little cost, and companies
willingly oblige to meet the demand. As companies are primarily focused on profiting, they too put the well-being of nature at a lower
priority They use the specialized knowledge of science where it is applicable to maximize productivity whether it be increasing crop
yield or increasing the size of livestock. The side-effects of this process, both good and ill are largely ignored.

The side-effects of food production aren’t always irrelevant though to the common man, especially when the unexpected side-effects
get out of control and cause significant harm. In the desire to increase crop-yield, science has developed numerous chemical fertilizers
which almost miraculously increase food yield beyond what [Malthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus)
could have believed. But as a side-effect, the fertilizers contaminate local water supplies which lead to negative health effects and/or
negatively impact water sources which impact the fish stocks and other life in the aquatic environment. When this side-effect or another
arises from food production, a scientific or legal solution is developed to correct the specific problem. Though while the symptom is
cured, the underlying cause remains. Since food is obtained for most people separately from the environment, the direct mental connection
between the individual food and the negative side-effect of its production is rarely made. A side-effect doesn’t have to cause significant
harm to gain relevance in a person’s mind. There is an awareness of the necessity to consume a variety of foods to remain healthy. Since
the advent of readily available industrialized food, the quality of that food has diminished. As a result, people have become somewhat
conscious of the fact that certain nutrients/ingredients are necessary for survival, thanks in part to nutritionism. But nutritionism
is specialized knowledge, as is the industry’s desire to provide a specialized product to fulfill a specific demand. As was alluded to
earlier, even though consumers are conscious of certain necessary ingredients, they are for the most part unaware of the combinatorial
effects of consuming their food choices the way they do. This parallels the picking and choosing of problem solving in the natural world.
As a specific problems arises, a specific solution is developed, and the natural problem is only a problem once it intrudes upon the
unnatural world of modern society.

The specialized existence of modern society contrasts sharply from traditional society as well as the interconnected existence of the
natural world. Consumers unwittingly pluck at the web of nature by plucking at the individual ingredients of the foods chosen to eat
through a misguided specialization of nutrient knowledge. As they pluck, the ripples propagate through the web of interdependencies
leading to more and more unexpected consequences. But specialized knowledge is not even in and of itself, a problem neither is the way
in which nutritionists practice it in their research. While true that the common consumer may not understand the implications of the
researchers’ discoveries and may in fact come to many false conclusions in regards to changing their respective diets, it is not practical
to demand that nutritionists be responsible for unraveling all potential consequences of individuals applying their research results in the
layperson’s daily life.

So what does the future hold if the relationship between humanity and nature is dominated by a lack of involvement in the natural world?
If the rough divide between mental relevance and environmental impact continue, it can be expected that the numerous negative side-effects
of this interaction will continue. Studying the modern food industry and its interaction between consumer and nature aptly parallels the
average person’s interaction with nature in other aspects of life. If the important subject of how food is obtained and how it’s produced
impacts other aspects of life, it would lead to a higher quality of life and a reduced environmental impact. Currently the feeling of personal
responsibility for eating of food is shrugged off onto an industry that may very well be just as indifferent to the impact of its activities.

What alternative system would better help people cope with and improve their relationship with nature? With food being such a necessity for
survival, and since food comes oftentimes directly from the environment, it would be an excellent conduit through which a new relationship
could grow. Changing the interpretation of food may be the best approach for a long term change in the way this interaction could occur. Perhaps
by re-introducing and evolving an older tradition, or by developing new food traditions that promote more emphasis on reducing environmental
impact while promoting better eating would practically improve quality of life. Religion already uses this idea in some degree in the way that
it seeks to promote and maintain a variety of food traditions. Without delving into the specifics of individual religious beliefs such as Jewish
Kosher foods or Catholic diet restrictions, it can be sufficed to say that their maintenance of a particular food tradition, in this case a
tradition of what foods are okay to be eaten, can be considered a safe bet upon which to grow. Since the major world religions are centuries old,
it is an existential proof that what has been eaten thus far has not impacted people or the environment in a significant way that is unsustainable.
For example, it is unheard of for a Jewish or Catholic practitioner on a strict traditional diet to die of malnutrition or starvation as a result.
There is also little evidence of any particular species of animal becoming extinct as a direct result of the teachings of one of these specific
religions. It is not being argued that current eating practices be replaced outright by an existing religious tradition, nor that related. beliefs
beyond the respective food traditions be adopted, but rather that numerous existing traditions can provide an instance of
[Chesterton’s Fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence) from which one can evolve. If these are
tempered with the knowledge obtained through the scientific discoveries of nutritionists and dietitians, it could reduce the migration tax of existing
diets, and more readily adopted by western society as they would already be familiar to most and not consist of foods alien to the palette.

### TODO

In the future I might expand on and return to the priest-like class of experts in a conclusive paragraph.
