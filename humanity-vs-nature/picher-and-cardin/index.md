The first couple decades of my life were overall not very pleasant. One chapter of this was when we lived with an
uncle for a short time in a small town in Oklahoma: Picher-Cardin. I was surprised recently to find out that a
documentary was made about the place. You may find it interesting and it describes the area and situation better
than I could have:

We were also told that biker gangs would dump bodies in the old mines. I never saw this myself, but it wouldn't have been surpising.

On Wikipedia you can find more details under the [Tar Creek Superfund site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_Creek_Superfund_site).
