<blockquote>
    <p>Hi All,</p>
    <p>First of all, I am very glad to be a part of this awesome mailing list. Lets keep it alive :) Now, to the topic:<br>I have tried to find a decent overview or an open discussion (if there is one) about the substantial differences of prefix vs postfix notation for concatenative languages, but I couldn’t. Also, I would like to discuss potential advantages of different evaluation schemes. I would be grateful if any could provide clarifications to the statements and give some examples, maybe. So:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Postfix, left-to-right evaluation<br> Well, this is like any FORTH-like language we know. Values and quotations are pushed onto the stack, operations and combinators are directly executed.</li>
    <li>Postfix, right-to-left evaluation This one is used, as far as I know only in <a href="https://github.com/joshsh/ripple" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener noopener noreferrer">Ripple</a>. Values, execution tokens and such are pushed onto the stack and only evalueted once explicit apply “.” is encountered. Are there any direct advantages to that scheme, aside from the “inehrent” lazyness for all operations (say: we save some quoting here and there…)?</li>
    <li>Prefix, left-to-right evaluation<br> As far as I know, this one is <a href="http://om-language.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener noopener noreferrer">Om Language</a>. The author itself mentions following advantages of a prefix notation:
    <ul>
    <li>
<em>Prefix notation more closely models function composition. Instead of storing a data stack in memory, the Om evaluator stores a composed partial function.</em><br> – So? We can do that in a normal postifx notation as well, as <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/xy/xy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener noopener noreferrer">XY</a> does.</li>
    <li>
<em>The evaluator can read, parse and evaluate the input stream in a single pass, sending results to the output stream as soon as they are evaluated. This cannot be done with a postfix, stack-based language because any data on the stack must remain there as it may be needed by a function later.</em><br> – Could someone give some examples here (and/or counter-examples)? I can’t get this :(</li>
    <li>
<em>Functions can be optimized to only read into memory the data that is required; stack-based postfix languages have no knowledge of the function to apply until the data is already in memory, on the stack. </em><br> – I guess we can get this for free with postfix, right-to-left evaluation, right?</li>
    <li>
<em>Incoming data, such as events, become simple to handle at a language level: a program might evaluate to a function that acts as a state machine that processes any additional data appended to the program and transitions to a new state, ready to process new data.</em><br> – Damn, I don’t get that either :(</li>
    <li>
<em>An integrated development environment can provide hints to the user about the data that is expected by a function. </em> – Why we can’t do the same for posfix? Almost every definition in forth-like languages has stack-effect diagram, so IDE can use that, right? What is a benefit of having prefix here? BTW, why there is no IDE that will show stack effect diagram inside a definition automatically, based on a current cursor position?</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Prefix, right-to-left evaluation<br>I guess this is totally useless and not possible, right? :)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>
    <p>Best Regards,<br> Artjoms.</p>

    <p>Yes, I’ve read this a number of times over the years. Is there anything in particular you want to point to in the ~50 pages referenced?</p>
    <p>Immediately before section 1.5, for instance, is the following which is similar to what I said earlier (irt. monadic forms):</p>
    <p><br>“Syntactic rules are further simplified by adopting a single form for all dyadic functions, which appear between their arguments, and for all monadic functions, which appear before their arguments.”</p>

    <p>Hi, everybody! I heard from Artyom that folks were interested in some clarifications about Om. My mind hasn’t been in the language for a while, but I’ll see if I can shed some light on what I was trying to get at on the website. Some of that is likely specific to Om vs. prefix languages in general.<br><br>&gt; Prefix notation more closely models function composition. Instead of storing a data stack in memory, the Om evaluator stores a composed partial function.<br><br>The in-memory state of a computation in a postfix language is represented by a data stack. In Om, an in-memory computation is a function stack, which is analogous to a function composition.<br><br>For example, the hypothetical Om program “swap {A}” would first push the “swap” function, then the constant “{A}” function. The function stack now represents the composition of “swap” and “{A}”.<br><br>&gt; The evaluator can read, parse and evaluate the input stream in a single pass, sending results to the output stream as soon as they are evaluated. This cannot be done with a postfix, stack-based language because any data on the stack must remain there as it may be needed by a function later.<br><br>Think of Om as a stream-based language that rewrites a program from an input stream into a program sent to an output stream.<br><br>In the above example: when “{B}” is pushed onto “swap {A}”, the state is “swap {A} {B}”, which the interpreter then rewrites as “{B} {A}”. These are both constant functions, and since there is no way that any remaining program could modify these (because it is prefix), they can be written to the output stream.<br><br>So for the program “swap {A} {B} swap {C}”, this will get rewritten to “{B} {A} swap {C}”, and {B} and {A} can be written to the output stream, leaving only “swap {C}” on the “function stack”. When the constant program {D} gets pushed, {D} and {C} are output to the output stream, leaving the function stack empty.<br><br>To better understand evaluation in Om: given the program “swap {A} swap {B} {C}”, the interpreter will:<br>– Push “swap” onto the function stack<br>– Push “{A}” onto the function stack<br>– Push “swap” onto the function stack<br>– Push “{B}” onto the function stack<br>– Push “{C}” onto the function stack<br>– Rewrite the program as “swap {A} {C} {B}”<br>– Rewrite the program as “{C} {A} {B}”<br>– Output constant functions “{C}”, “{A}”, and “{B}”.<br>– The function stack is now empty.<br><br>&gt; Functions can be optimized to only read into memory the data that is required; stack-based postfix languages have no knowledge of the function to apply until the data is already in memory, on the stack.<br><br>An example is the “drop” function. In Om, when the “drop” function is pushed onto the stack, any constant function that follows (i.e. an operand) will cause the “drop” function and the constant function to be rewritten as an empty program.<br><br>In a postfix language, a function like this would first require the operand to be pushed onto a data stack in memory, and then “drop” would come along and remove it.<br><br>Om, however, never needs to read the full the operand into memory. The “drop” function can read the operand directly from the input stream and discard the characters as they come in.<br><br>&gt; Incoming data, such as events, become simple to handle at a language level: a program might evaluate to a function that acts as a state machine that processes any additional data appended to the program and transitions to a new state, ready to process new data.<br><br>As any Om computation is a “function stack” (which represents a composed function), one could imagine that events could arrive as program elements on the input stream, thereby changing the state of the program to a new state, ready to receive new events. Therefore, a simple event-handling mechanism is central to the language.<br><br>&gt; An integrated development environment can provide hints to the user about the data that is expected by a function.<br><br>The idea here is that the operator is typed first in a prefix language (followed by its operands). As soon as the operator is entered, the operands it expects could be indicated to the user by an IDE. (I suppose this breaks down for people who typically enter data in a right-to-left direction in their text editor…)<br><br>Thanks again for the interest! Hope that helps. Please let me know if any of that still doesn’t make sense.<br><br>Jason</p>
