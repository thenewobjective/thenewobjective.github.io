Do you have a more specific question? I am engaged in a number 
of endeavors, companies, and initiatives.

What's the most interesting software development you've worked 
on so far. Also what issues have you seen thus far With software & 
network integration? I'd like to understand what areas of I.T 
infrastructure seem to be a major limitation in software 
development/implementetlon. 
Thank you, 
Khaled

As mentioned I engage in a variety of endeavors in e number of 
fields from Al to Compilers to warehouse automation to Military 
systems and more. 
The limitations of software in general are best described by 
Conway's Law: "Your code reflects your organization". 
What I've come to understand about Convvefs law is that at some 
point you change code without changing the organization. 
This is reflected by Microsoft's recent study into the cause of 
Bugs:

Thus to be more impactful, one should strive to engage above the 
tactical level of implementation end instead work to effect change 
at the Operational or Strategic level for a business.
