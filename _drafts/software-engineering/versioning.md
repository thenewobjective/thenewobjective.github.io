Notes
	- SemVer is incompatible with staggered releases?
	- Web browser style release numbers become pointless. Formerly were milestones. Now what are they? 
	- Versions vs Revisions
	- Brendan Eich

	- Hashcode as version?
		○ Am I versioning for the user, or for the machine?

	- If I change a UI or grossly update documentation, is that a Major version bump in SemVer if the API is the code is unchanged?
	- What if the build system changes? WebPack => ParcelJS? 
		○ The compiled source could be equivalent, but the source code is different. Hence version vs revision are different
		○ Release vs Version vs Revision?
	- Licensing number vs version.
