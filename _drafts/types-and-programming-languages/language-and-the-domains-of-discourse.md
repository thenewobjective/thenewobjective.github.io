Background

[Language](http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot.htm) is a tool of thought. With the invention of symbols we give ideas form; through their composition we give them life; but we are [limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two). To assault the higher towers of reasoning, and to convey our progress to others we must extend our minds [beyond ourselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_cognition) and into our environment. 

Writing is one of the greatest steps. 

{Writing may have been the most important invention of our species up to now. It is so important that we've attributed it to numerous [gods of antiquity](http://etc.ancient.eu/education/the-divine-gift-of-writing/). } {What of drawing? Doing with images create symbols}

{writing is but a snapshot of our thoughts and the anima of execution., and therefore no better than a statue or corpse.}


 {We can not deal with the universe as a whole so we subdivide it into domains of discourse (noumenon? Goedel's incompleteness?)}

Introduction

â€¦

We can not speak of all things at once., for there is no differentiation in ideas. 

We must first limit ourselves, limit our ideas in order to differentiate them, to give them being. 

This act of limitation, and therefore differentiation, is what is referred to as a Domain of Discourse.
