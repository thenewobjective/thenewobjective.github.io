Programming Language vs Programming System

A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms123.

On the other hand, a programming system is a combination of a programming language and its associated tools and environments.
It includes not only the language syntax and semantics, but also libraries, a runtime system, development tools (like compilers or interpreters),
debuggers, integrated development environments (IDEs), etc456.

For instance, Smalltalk, Self, and Newspeak are all examples of programming systems:

Smalltalk was a revolutionary system developed by the Learning Research Group (LRG) at Xerox PARC in the 1970s. It was comprised of a programming language, a development environment, and a graphical user interface (GUI)4.
Self is a prototype-based dynamic object-oriented programming language. The Self system is implemented in itself: Compiler, debugger, programming tools, and so on are all Self code the user can read and modify5.
Newspeak is a programming language and platform in the tradition of Smalltalk and Self. The platform includes an integrated development environment (IDE), a graphical user interface (GUI) library, and standard libraries6.
In summary, while a programming language provides the syntax and semantics for describing computations, a programming system also provides the tools and environment to make the development process easier and more efficient.
