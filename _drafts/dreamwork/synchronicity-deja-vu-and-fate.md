## Introduction

From time-to-time I engage in consulting work. Recently during a discovery session I was
hit with a heavy sense of [déjà vu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu). As the
client was answering one of my questions, I knew exactly what they were going to say word-for-word
for the next few sentences. I also came to the realization that I had dreamt this exact moment
only a week prior. This sense of déjà vu was in this case a memory of the future.

The dream itself was not particularly memorable or unexpected. I was anticipating
the upcoming consulting work, so it was on my mind. It was also not particularly vivid or
detailed. It was simply a dream of me sitting and moving about a room with a handful
of people I didn't recognize. The room was also unfamiliar. There were some conversations
occurring, and I was asking questions. I would have forgotten the dream entirely if it
was more than just a week prior. It wasn't a vague dream, so the details weren't fuzzy,
it was just unremarkable.

## Anecdotes

I am not the first to have experienced this phenomenon, and it apparently has a more specific
name: `Déjà rêvé` or `already dreamed`. There is a Reddit
[thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DejaReve/comments/zm12nn/does_anyone_else_suffer_from_deja_reve/)
with some anecdotes. A more famous account is described by [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung):

> Among many cases of this sort, I have been especially impressed with one that concerned

> time to time, and who always teased me on these occasions about my interest in
> dream-interpretation. I met him one day in the street, and he called out to me:
> “How are things going? Are you still interpreting dreams? By the way, I’ve had another
> idiotic dream. Does it mean something too?” He had dreamed as follows: “I am climbing a
> high mountain over steep, snow-covered slopes. I mount higher and higher — it is marvellous
> weather. The higher I climb, the better I feel. I think: ‘If only I could go on climbing
> like this for ever!’ When I reach the summit, my happiness and elation are so strong that
> I feel I could mount right up into space. And I discover that I actually can do this. I go
> on climbing on empty air. I awake in a real ecstasy.” When he had told me his dream, I said:
> “My dear man, I know you can’t give up mountaineering, but let me implore you not to go
> alone from now on. When you go, take two guides, and you must promise on your word of
> honour to follow their directions’.” “Incorrigible!” he replied laughing, and said good-bye.
> I never saw him again. Two months later came the first blow. When out alone, he was buried
> by an avalanche, but was dug out in the nick of time by a military patrol which happened to
> came along. Three months after this the end came. He went on a climb accompanied by a younger
> friend, but without guides. An alpinist standing below saw him literally step out into the
> air as he was letting himself down a rock wall. He fell on to the head of his friend, who
> was waiting beneath him, and both were dashed to pieces far below. That was an ecstasis in
> the full meaning of the word.

There is also a blending of such predictive dreams with the concept of [Synchronicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity).
Jung has another excellent collection of anecdotes [here](https://carljungdepthpsychologysite.blog/2020/06/01/the-hereafter/)
and in his book [Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity_(book)).

## Speculations

How can such a thing be possible? Given the untold number of anecdotes it's a real phenomenon,
and the plural of anecdote is evidence but evidence of what?

## Notes

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity>
- I showed my mother a potoo bird camouflaging itself. Moments later she saw one on an arbitrary Netflix movie.
- I used to see the number 3 and 33 often (multiple times a week)
- Is Numerology an attempt to identify and utilize Synchronicity?
- Tragedies Come in Threes

  - <http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/334>
- Joe Rogan talks about John Witherspoon on his podcast the same day he died without knowing it. (Joe Rogan Experience #1372)
- Early one morning I decided to read about an old UFO story later that day my mother decided to watch a ufo movie which she very rarely does. Tucker Carlson that evening had a story about UFOs
- Are things like Tarot and astrology a fumbling attempt at understanding Synchronicity?
  - relation to nominative determinism
  - Déjà vu
- October 22nd, 2020. I was thinking about a letter that a High School teacher wrote to me about Gitchi Manitous. I knew it was buried somewhere in my library but it would be a search that would take hours for me to find it.
- October 23rd, I was talking with my brother about a video game and I arbitrarily grabbed the related game manual from the bookshelf. Inside the front cover of that manual was the letter I was thinking of the day before.
- I was watching a presentation by Bertrand Meyer on the Beauty of Software on 2021-03-11. I was late to watching it and had to view the recording. In that presentation he was speaking briefly on Euler. I switched to my twitter feed and a person I follow posted a topic on Euler.

- Synchronistic event: Jan 2 2024
  - Had a conversation in slack @ 9:21pm
  - R.B. said:
    "I like that one story where the CIA or Mossad (really, same thing, TBH), hacked some dudes car on Rodeo drive and made it accelerate into a pal tree. Wicked sick. Blame the AI doh ..."
  - I replied:
   "Oh, Michael Hastings ..."
  - Listened to JRE #2081 @ 10 pm the same day where he mentions Michael Hastings death
