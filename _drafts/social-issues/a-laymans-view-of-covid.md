*With the deluge of information both fact and fiction as well as the active censorship of
people and ideas surrounding the pandemic I've decided to consolidate and distill what
seem consistent with the reality of the situation as I see it. Note that I am not an
expert in any field directly relevant to the topic. This is a living document I am
using as a personal reference. Perhaps you'll find it informative as well.*

## Do masks work

This topic is the most politicized and one where seemingly everyone has a "common-sense" opinion.

The short answer is "yes" masks work but not for what you think they do.

## Is Hydroxychloroquine effective

Yes, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is probably effective as a treatment for COVID-19 when
used early.

## Why is/was HCQ info censored

## Why Did I Lose my Sense of Smell?

Some researchers claim that the virus attacks the olfactory nerves:

<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32556089/>

Others disagree and claim that it's the olfactory support cells that are attacked:

<https://hms.harvard.edu/news/how-covid-19-causes-loss-smell>

The latter article claims that "...olfactory sensory neurons do not express the gene that
encodes the ACE2 receptor protein, which SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter human cells."

This is consistent with the following study:

> "We show that the cell surface protein ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2 are expressed in
> sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium but not, or much less, in most olfactory receptor neurons."
> <cite><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32379417/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32379417/</a></cite>

Omega-3 supplementation may help prevent this problem or aid in recovery:

## Can the WHO Be Trusted on This Topic?

Personally I do not.

I first became suspicious of the WHO after the following interview with one of their officials:

* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlCYFh8U2xM>

This seemed to show a significant amount of bias towards China. Given China's desire to maintain a certain
public opinion in regards to the cause, the spread, and handling of the pandemic it would not be surprising
that a certain level of pressure is being made on the organization.
