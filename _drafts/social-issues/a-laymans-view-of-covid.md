*With the deluge of information both fact and fiction as well as the active censorship of
people and ideas surrounding the pandemic I've decided to consolidate and distill what
seem consistent with the reality of the situation as I see it. Note that I am not an
expert in any field directly relevant to the topic. This is a living document I am
using as a personal reference. Perhaps you'll find it informative as well.
Comments and corrections welcome.*

## (TODO) What is COVID-19

### Variants

Wikipedia has a [page describing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_SARS-CoV-2) the variants of the virus

## (TODO) How Dangerous is it

There is a [study](https://rep.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/rep/aop/rep-20-0382/rep-20-0382.xml)
claiming that male fertility can be impacted in the short-term (60 days).

## (TODO) How it spreads

There have been a number of news reports of viral spread in meat packing plants. 

The cold stale air seems to allow the virus to spread farther and survive longer
according to a [German study](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-23/virus-can-jump-26-feet-at-cold-meat-plants-filled-with-stale-air). There are
a disproportionate number of dark-skinned employees at these plants who are known
to be at [higher risk](#vitamin-d).


A German
study was performed showing that <em>"... aerosolized coronavirus can hang in the air
for at least 30 minutes and travel up to 14 feet."</em> and <em>"...at around 37C (98F),
it can survive for two to three days on glass, fabric, metal, plastic or paper."

## (TODO) Do masks work

This topic is the most politicized and one where seemingly everyone has a "common-sense" opinion.

I prefer to follow the advice of Computer Scientist Frank Atanassow:

> "There is a big difference between something being true, knowing that it
> is true, and knowing that you know it is true. We might say something is
> true if it is a theorem; we know that it's true if we know it is a theorem
> and there exists a proof; and we know that we know it's true if we can
> exhibit a proof that we understand.
>
> If the first were the same as the last, then there would be no need for
> science or mathematics or objectively verifiable methods of argument.
> Furthermore, we would not be having this discussion in the first place,
> since truth would be self-evident, and so we could not possibly disagree."

> <cite><a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/175#comment-1333" target="_blank">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/175#comment-1333</a></cite>

In the field of Epidemiology where I am not qualified I must settle for simpler
tools to form a conclusion; namely by seeking consistency and identifying contradictions.
Consistency is truth and contradiction is falsity.

My conclusion is that in general they seem to do more harm than good.

The following is an aggregate of numerous studies (including a Randomized Control Trial)
showing little to no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks:

* <https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/>

### Surgical masks

[According to the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-surgical-masks-and-face-masks#s2):

> While a surgical mask may be effective in blocking splashes and large-particle droplets,
> a face mask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that
> may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures. Surgical masks
> also do not provide complete protection from germs and other contaminants because of
> the loose fit between the surface of the mask and your face.

### Do masks reduce O2 or increase CO2

#### N95 Masks

According to [this study](http://rc.rcjournal.com/content/55/5/569) they might:

> The FFR dead-space oxygen and carbon dioxide levels did not meet the
> Occupational Safety and Health Administration's ambient workplace standards.
> [...]
> In healthy healthcare workers, FFR did not impose any important physiological
> burden during 1 hour of use, at realistic clinical work rates, but the FFR
> dead-space carbon dioxide and oxygen levels were significantly above and
> below, respectively, the ambient workplace standards, and elevated P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>
> is a possibility. Exhalation valve did not significantly ameliorate the 
> FFR's P<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> impact.


#### Cloth Masks

People wear a variety of cloth masks with a large range of effectiveness.
Lately there is a fad of wearing two or three masks simultaneously.
Thicker masks would increase breathing difficulty.

Personal anecdote: I noticed that when I starting wearing a mask there were a few times
where I became light headed and nearly passed-out. I noticed later that I was
changing the way that I was breathing through the mask unconsciously. After changing
my breathing patterns this was no longer an issue.

### Hygiene

If the masks are not disposed after use or effectively washed they can increase
the odds of infection by many pathogens beyond COVID-19. Some examples:

Interestingly a [research paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18710327/) that includes [Fauci](#can-fauci-be-trusted)
as a co-author concludes that: <em>"The majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic
likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper
respiratory-tract bacteria."</em>

While masks are not mentioned in the study, I can't help but wonder if this is a risk that
should be considered in our current pandemic. Has any study evaluated this for COVID-19?

## Will supplements provide protection

Don't rely on supplements to replace a vaccine. Supplementation
would be wise to provide added protection by supporting your
immune system and general health.

### Vitamin C (TODO)

### Vitamin D

The evidence seems to suggest that Vitamin D is one of the most significant
hormones that can reduce mortality and improve outcomes of infection:

<https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/vitamin-d-covid-19>

This is consistent with the statistics showing that darker-skinned
people are at higher risk of negative outcomes:

> "African Americans have 24.6 times higher vitamin D deficiency and 3Â·7 times higher vitamin D insufficiency than Caucasians"

Reminder: your body synthesizes Vitamin-D in the skin when exposed to sunlight (UVB radiation)

## (TODO) Is Hydroxychloroquine effective

Yes, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is probably effective as a treatment for COVID-19 when

## (TODO) Why is/was HCQ info censored

## (TODO) Why Did I Lose my Sense of Smell?

Some researchers claim that the virus attacks the olfactory nerves:

<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32556089/>

Others disagree and claim that it's the olfactory support cells that are attacked:

<https://hms.harvard.edu/news/how-covid-19-causes-loss-smell>

The latter article claims that "...olfactory sensory neurons do not express the gene that
encodes the ACE2 receptor protein, which SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter human cells."

This is consistent with the following study:

> "We show that the cell surface protein ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2 are expressed in
> sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium but not, or much less, in most olfactory receptor neurons."

## Can Fauci Be Trusted (TODO)

No. He has openly admitted to lying to the public for political

## (TODO) Can the WHO Be Trusted

Personally I do not.

I first became suspicious of the WHO after the following interview with one of their officials:

{% include youtube.html id="UlCYFh8U2xM" %}

This seemed to show a significant amount of bias towards China.

I also came across an [opinion piece](https://archive.is/NzH6X) describing their past political behavior.

There are contradictions in their messaging as well:

> Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no
> clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus 
> (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.
> <cite><a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152" target="_blank">Twitter @WHO: Jan 14, 2020</a></cite>

With the above in mind note that [YouTube says](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/youtube-ceo-well-delete-anything-that-contradicts-word-health-organization-on-covid-19)
they will delete anything that contradicts the WHO.

## Can the CDC be trusted

As much as I hate to admit it, the CDC is also politicized and its claims
require scrutiny.

Their health claims and guidance have changed drastically since the pandemic started.

In March of 2020 the CDC [advised against](https://web.archive.org/web/20200328174347/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fprevention.html)
wearing a mask if you are not symptomatic. Now they say they are mandatory, unless it's an N95 mask.

[According to the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-surgical-masks-and-face-masks):

> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend
> that the general public wear N95 respirators to protect themselves from
> respiratory diseases, including coronavirus (COVID-19). Those are critical
> supplies that must continue to be reserved for health care workers and
> other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.

## Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness

There are multiple vaccines. Safety and effectiveness has to be judged for each.

In regards to effectiveness for the multi-dose varieties it should not be surprising to hear
[reports](https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/er-nurse-tests-positive-covid-8-days-after-being-vaccinated)
of COVID infection after receiving only a single dose or [reports](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/new-york-congressman-who-got-vaccine-diagnosed-with-covid/ar-BB1cKMAV)
of infection immediately after the second dose.

According to [Paul Stoffels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Stoffels):

> "a one-shot vaccine is considered by the World Health Organization to be the best option in pandemic settings, enhancing access, distribution and compliance."

Sounds reasonable but WHO comments have to be heavily [scrutinized](#can-the-who-be-trusted).

### AstraZeneca

This is an [adenovirus-based vaccine](https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-are-Adenovirus-Based-Vaccines.aspx).

According to their [Preprint](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3777268),
it is 100% effective in reducing symptoms of COVID-19 enough that hospitalization can be avoided.
They also claim 76% protection after the first dose. Two doses are required and they can not be
given close together or it would be less effective.

There are [multiple](https://web.archive.org/web/20201216135047if_/https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/astrazeneca-vaccine-only-62-effective-impact-elderly-unclear-more-data-needed)
[claims](https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/it-just-doesnt-work-expected-macron-questions-covid-vaccine-credibility-eu-approves)
that this effectiveness is exaggerated and possibly ineffective for those over
the age of 65.

### Johnson & Johnson - Janssen

The company [claims](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial) 66% overall effectiveness at
preventing moderate to severe symptoms with a single dose.
It is reportedly only 57% effective against the South African mutation.

This is disappointing information.

### Pfizer

The Pfizer vaccine is an mRNA vaccine.

According to [this publication](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577?query=RP) the efficacy
of the vaccine is 52% with one dose and 95% with two doses.

The Israeli's [claim](https://news.yahoo.com/israel-warning-single-dose-pfizer-124313138.html) that this is
exaggerated and that the first dose is only 33% effective.

Congressman Espaillat [tested positive](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/new-york-congressman-who-got-vaccine-diagnosed-with-covid/ar-BB1cKMAV) after receiving
both doses of this vaccine. Depending on [how that test was performed](#casedemic) this may
just be a false positive as he claims to have experienced no symptoms.
Though with the Israeli's reported effectiveness reduction it is something to consider.

### Moderna

This is an mRNA vaccine that requires two doses.

The company [claims](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against) effectiveness against the
UK variant but is six-times less effective against the South African variant.

The vaccine is approved for those age 18 and older.

[Side effects have been reported for those with cosmetic facial fillers](https://nypost.com/2020/12/25/moderna-covid-vaccine-has-caused-side-effects-for-those-with-cosmetic-facial-fillers)

> âYour immune system which causes inflammation is revved up when you get a vaccine, thatâs how itâs supposed to work,â
> said Dr. Shirley Chi, who noted the side effects were easily treated by medical personnel.

Other allergic reactions are possible according to the company news release.

[California halted injections of Moderna Covid vaccine batch due to âhigher-than-usual number of adverse eventsâ](https://www.rt.com/usa/512825-moderna-california-vaccine-adverse-reactions/)

Interestingly the [FDA report](https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download) doesn't seem to mention
which variant of COVID it is effective against and claims 94.5% efficacy in preventing infection
after the 2nd dose. This also mentions severe adverse reactions in 0.2% to 9.7% of participants
after the second dose. This seems rushed.

It might be worth reviewing the section on Fauci [above](#can-fauci-be-trusted)

### Novavax

The company [claims](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3) 89.3% efficacy
against the UK variant of the virus and 49.4% against the South African variant.

Note that the South African variant has been [reported](https://nypost.com/2021/01/28/south-african-covid-19-strain-found-in-us/) in the United States.

WHO Quotes:

"we in the World Health Organization do not
advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control
of this virus. The only time we believe a lockdown is
justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup,
rebalance you resources, protect your health
workers who are exhausted, but by and large, we'd
rather not do it."

"Locdowns just have one consequence that you
musr never every belittle, and that is making poor
people an awful lot poorer.
Look what's happened to smallholder farmers all
over the world. Look what's happening to poverty
levels, It seems that we may well have a doubling of
world poverty by next year.
We may well have at least a doubling of child
malnutrition."
