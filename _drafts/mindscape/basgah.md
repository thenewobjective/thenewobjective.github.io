I dreamt I was in a place best described as hell.
There was a man dressed darkly and seemed ancient, almost vampiric in his appearance and demeanor. He wanted to teach me what at first seemed to be a game but turned out to be much more.

He threatened to kill me if I damaged the pieces as they were each hand made by him in memory of someone. The pieces were an aged parchment and a string of what appeared to be well-worn wood blocks of ebony and ivory color approximately a half inch each.

I could not tell how these blocks were connected but they were fully articulated and could be transformed from a string to any polyomino whether it was  2D or 3D

The ebony color he called "Bas" and the ivory color "Gah"

On the parchment there was a marking upon which the polyomino was placed and constrained. An outline of a different polyomino with a single block designated as "start". My teacher referred to this with the letter "I" and said it had no name and that it was "unrepresentable".

At this point I no longer thought of this as some game but as some form of haptic programming.  I suggested the term "Identity" and at hearing this my teacher's demeanor changed. He was satisfied and wished for me to write my name upon the parchment so that he could remember me and that he would show me how to perform arithmetic next time we met. I had a glimpse in my mind of a numeric expression in what appeared to be a Stack effect diagram oriented vertically. 

I wrote the name "Dreamer" and awakened.

…

Instead of waiting in hope of another dream lesson I can take this as inspiration and attempt to realize this mysterious construct.

I have very little to go one so I must first start with a note dump of possibly relevant information
