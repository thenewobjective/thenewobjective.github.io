Deepest Dark

A black fog or mist befalls a town on the edge of the wilderness. Like a somewhat hilly suburban area near a swamp or the outback

When the darkness falls it makes things nut just dark but pitch black. Not star no light. You can't see the hand in front of your face. 

The strongest light can't penetrate it and is lost in its depth. 

There are strange animal noises in it like hyenas or coyotes. 

In the area where the darkness falls there are strange drawings on walls and buildings that can only be seen in twilight when a flashlight light is used

The look like some tribal marks. Strange combination of luminescent filled circles  surrounded by other variations of broken concentric ones

Some people are possessed by the darkness and slowly become dark spawn ghouls or creatures like those in Alan Wake. 

Like those in Alan Wake, they are harmed by light where it can cause disintegration. 

The native creatures of the dark seem to be these potbelly, squat, naked, slightly overweight, almost goblin like creatures with brownish skin. Like the goblin from labyrinth but fatter and black hair 

They are not harmed by light but avoid it. They create the drawings and are denizens of the dark. Not evil but vengeful for some reason and kidnap those in their tett for unknown reasons. 

They seem different from the dark possessed. 

The encroachment on some particular wilderness by suburban development seems to have unleashed the dark. 

The dark possessed humans and animals are just plainly violent and assault anyone to cause harm. They echo phrases of their former selves but are Hollow things. Time twists them further

Daytime has an unknown effect on the dark

The extent of it is not know either as the point of view is from the survivors within. 

Something leviathan and foress lives in the dark and can assault large objects. Like the thing that chases the protagonist in Evil Dead.
