We're not living in a simulation. It's no different than saying everything is a dream (see blog post on responding to morpheus).

The statistical argument is lame.
It's like saying there are more ways for us not to exist than exist therefore we probably do not exist.
    The Selfish Gene book has some commentary on this I believe.
