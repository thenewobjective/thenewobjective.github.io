"""
On one of my teams, we did Planning Poker estimation and tracked actual time spent on each story.

Our stats nerd found a weak correlation between points & time for stories estimated at 1, 2, and 3 points.

5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100? Statistically indistinguishable.

After you have run a few sprints, the emphasis usually starts to shift from resolving uncertainty to completing features so that they can be released – at least to selected users. It allows you to gather quantitative data and to understand how users employ your product in its target environment. The shift should be reflected in your sprint goal, which now focuses on “getting stuff done” rather than testing ideas

https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/scrum-master-studio-series-frame-2-sprint-goal

In other words, after a few billing cycles to the client we can start releasing the things they asked for

In "Agile" there is a tendency to throw away a significant amount of Architecture and key documentation

strange aversion to UML?

In Agile they don't count the cost of planning?
	in LCs case that's 25% - 30% of the budget/time and 0% of the velocity measured?

Minimal is not simple

Moving from testing and pre-release verification to 
live feedback and deployment fixes
	Like Tesla <https://youtu.be/ikMmkHzlTpk?t=2729>
	Like the DevOps movement
Software impossible to test is the claim, therefore you must do it live
	It's one thing to instantly push an update, what if I push an instant brick?
	All hacks become global?

Pushes software back into an analogous form of biology:
	Natural Selection?

You can't spell Fragile without Agile 

if agile is so great why is our software so bad?

Scrum
	estimated effort vs actual effort and point value
