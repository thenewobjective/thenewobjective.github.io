        We re-read 23 smart contract audits and found:
        - 78% of high impact, easily exploitable findings are discoverable with automated analysis tools
        - 50% of all findings will never be found with automated tools
        - Unit testing _has no impact on security_

Don't unit test what works? Only look for what should fail? A test is an existence proof. So check falsifiable information?

"The real value of tests is not that they detect bugs in the code, but that they detect inadequacies in the methods, concentration, and skills of those who design and produce the code." — C.A.R. Hoare

In support of TDD:
	My unit test approach It demonstrates consistency with requirements

===============
Blind Coverage

Getting 100% but not actually having valid tests


When a measure becomes a target…


========

Is the existence of Unit Testing a design pattern and therefore a language smell?

How much to Code Contracts and Type Systems Subsume?
