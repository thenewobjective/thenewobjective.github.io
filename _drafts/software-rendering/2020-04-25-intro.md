There are many tutorials and books dedicated to graphics programming and programming on the web.
Personally I've felt that there is something missing. I've longed for a guide to graphics programming
in a declarative, simple style that has a breadth of coverage that I could use for the web. I've
given up on the search and have decided to write the tutorial I wanted to see.

This guide will follow a declarative Object Oriented Design. It will utilize JavaScript and `<canvas>`.
The `<canvas>` drawing api's will not be used and will instead be built from scratch by manipulating
the canvas `ImageData` directly.

Choosing an appropriate place to start can be challenging; one wants to be simple without being simplistic.
Instead of introducing how to plot pixels on the screen and building up from there we'll instead start with
the entities we care about and then figure out how to render them. Each chapter will follow this style.
