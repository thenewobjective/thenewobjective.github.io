Tile-based graphics were a popular way to render 2D games in the 80s and 90s.
They are still used today despite the advent of 3D graphics due to their simplicity, efficiency,
and nostalgic appeal. I am also guilty of having soft spot for them, and have
created a few tile-based games myself in the late 90s. These games have long since bit-rotted.
I have decided to revisit this topic and create a series of posts detailing the creation of a
tile-based game engine from scratch.

While the target platform for this engine is the web, the techniques used here are applicable
to any platform that supports 2D graphics. The engine will be written in TypeScript and follow
the [Clean Architecture](https://crosp.net/blog/software-architecture/clean-architecture-part-1-databse-vs-domain/)
philosophy. An impressionistic overview of Clean Architecture:

If you've ever read another tutorial on graphics or game programming, you've probably
encountered an approach that falls into one of two categories:

1. It starts bottom up, with the graphics API, and works its way up to the game logic.
2. It starts top down, with the game logic, and works its way down to the graphics API.

I find both of these approaches to be unsatisfying. The first approach is too
low-level and you can end up with an overarching design that is not replicable across
multiple platforms or APIs. The second approach is too high-level and like magic
you have a game that runs on a screen, but you don't know the thought process that
actualized it; like Athena, who sprang forth fully formed from the head of Zeus
([ref](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/484770347364029322/)).

In this guide, I will take a middle-out approach in "vertical slices" that
incrementally build up the engine from the domain to the display. These slices
will be small enough to be easily digestible, but large enough to be meaningful.
Additional functionality will be added incrementally.

I'm assuming you have a basic understanding of programming and have at least
a vague idea of what Tile-based graphics are.
