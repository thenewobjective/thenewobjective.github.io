Far too often I see and am involved in arguments and discussions that suffer an abuse of foundational
definitions. Some of the words I think that are most abused are:
"fact", "evidence", "truth", "real", "exist", and "theory". There are more terms that people
use interchangeably in this category and their abuse leads to very prolonged often inconsequential
conclusions.

## Fact

A **Fact** is an object that is independent of our perceptions but has been obtained by us through some means.
Before this object is obtained it is referred to as phenomena: the thing in itself. If it's an object that is
impossible for us to obtain it is referred to as [noumena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumenon):
unknowable. An example of a phenomena is gravity. An example of noumenon I can't provide. It's an unknown unknown.

## Reality

<!--
Where does phenonema reside? Where is it located? What is this place independent of our perceptions?

{Do noumenon preside in reality? By definition they are not. That would give them a location which is ascribing more knowledge than we have about them. }

{are phenomenon real? Yes, by the above definition}

{Is santa claus real? No, it does not exist separate from us as a thing-in-itself. (Though we realize it).. }
{WHat is the difference between the things-in-themselves and things we bring into reality?}
{I can generate a reality through thoughts. Populate it with phenomenon, but it is not a shared reality?}
{a phenomenon without a name is not a fact?}
{Knowing the name of something gives you power over it}
{YHWH. Not  named}
{Not real? In other words not in our reality? Interacts via sefirot?}
{another word for real?, etc.}
-->
## Existence

<!--
{If I imagine something, does it exist?}
{WHere do I exist}
{exist in reality, or exist elsewhere?}
{Is there only reality and the place where noumenon reside?}
{Do noumenon reside in reality as well but are unobtainable?}
-->

## Evidence

{Obtained through our senses directly, epistemology, perhaps revelation}

## Knowledge

> ...because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are
> known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also
> unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know
> <cite>Donald Rumsfeld</cite>

If we obtain one or more facts, we aren't necessarily aware of them.

## Exists

...

## Real

## Hypothesis

...

## Truth



<!--
{There is a big difference between something being true, knowing that it is true, and knowing that you know it is true. We might say something is true if it is a theorem; we know that it's true if we know it is a theorem and there exists a proof; and we know that we know it's true if we can exhibit a proof that we understand.

If the first were the same as the last, then there would be no need for science or mathematics or objectively verifiable methods of argument. Furthermore, we would not be having this discussion in the first place, since truth would be self-evident, and so we could not possibly disagree.}

## Notes

* Godels incompleteness theorem (talks about the limits of theory? talks about the limits of obtainable truth and therefore facts?)
* turing incompleteness?
* I think therefore I am is a statement of existence? of reality? Not one of evidence.
* Nietzsche: plunge this knife into my heart and darken your world (Thus spake Zarathustra?)
* Establishing a fact-pattern
* "Alternative Facts"
* I reject your reality and substitute my own
* kids in MAGA hats and the indian in their face
* Theory from facts
  * You can't get an ought from an is
    * Prefer the simplest one (Occam's Razor)
* Plato's cave
* Theory guided by facts
* The role of science and its limits (Sciencism)
* Jordan Peterson vs Sam Harris debate
* Relationship to Information theory
* "root of the knowledge heap"
* Computer science is not a science (Feynman)
* Science is not math
* Math is not Logic
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory#Background>
* Empiricism
* Epistemology
* Unus Mundus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unus_mundus>
  * phenomenon and reality are not separate. facts and mind?
  * Knowledge, Information: Information theory. Knowledge not separate from reality?
* If "I" think, am I real? If "I" think, do I exist?
  * cogito, ergo sum
  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum>
* YHWH: unnamed, unknowable? Something in-between? (Cabala, sefirot)
  * Eldritch Horror
* Logos, The Word
* Matter un motion
* Real numbers are not physical relationship with noumena?
  * What of fantasy? Imaginative?
  * What of contradictive thoughts and theories?
* "Science doesn't really care about your beliefs. And no amount of belief makes something a fact" --Feynman
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_that_I_Am>
  * Not an evasion IMO. Moreso like Ashildr:

> Me: You mean… you haven’t come for me?
> The Doctor: No, it was just a coincidence. Oh Ashildr, I’m sorry.
> Me: Who’s Ashildr?
> The Doctor: You are. That’s your name. Ashildr, daughter of Ionhar. Chuckles, I used to call him Chuckles. You don’t remember?
> Me: Yes. I think I remember the village.
> The Doctor: You loved that village.
> Me: If you say so.
> The Doctor: Anyone in that village would have died for you.
> Me: Well. They’re all dead now and here I am. So I guess it all worked out.
>
> The Doctor: Well what do you call yourself?
> Me: Me.
> The Doctor: Yes, you. There’s nobody else here.
> Me: No. I call myself, “Me.” All my other names I chose died with who knew me. Me is who I am now. No one’s mother, daughter, wife. My own companion. Singular. Unattached. Alone.

  Now scale that sentiment to a Deity: "I am that I am"


  From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_Sof>:

> Before He gave any shape to the world, before He produced any form, He was alone, without form and without
> resemblance to anything else. Who then can comprehend how He was before the Creation? Hence it is forbidden
> to lend Him any form or similitude, or even to call Him by His sacred name, or to indicate Him by a single
> letter or a single point...

> Any name of God which is found in the Bible can not be applied to the Deity prior to His self-manifestation
> in the Creation, because the letters of those names were produced only after the emanation. . . . Moreover,
> a name implies a limitation in its bearer; and this is impossible in connection with the "Ein Sof".

What is more "real"? Phenomenon, or the abstraction explaining it?
Is a geometric circle more "real" than circular objects in the world?
Is the number 7 more "real" than 7 items on your desk?

empirical/procedural knowledge

	follow these steps and you'll get this result.
	fill in the blank and turn the crank
		you'll get what you want but not know why.
			iow, no theory just motions

=========
Penn Jilette

Science is predictive not necessarily explanatory.

Pseudo-science is predicting the past:
	You heard the dog bark and then you knew your mom died across the world,
	but you didn't know at the time the dog barked.
