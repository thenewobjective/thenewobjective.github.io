Far too often I see and am involved in arguments and discussions that suffer an abuse of foundational
definitions. Some of the words I think that are most abused are:
"fact", "evidence", "truth", "real", "exist", and "theory". There are more terms that people
use interchangeably in this category and their abuse leads to very prolonged often inconsequential
conclusions.

## Fact

A **Fact** is an object that is independent of our perceptions but has been obtained by us through some means.
Before this object is obtained it is referred to as phenomena: the thing in itself. If it's an object that is
impossible for us to obtain it is referred to as [noumena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumenon):
unknowable. An example of a phenomena is gravity. An example of noumenon I can't provide. It's an unknown unknown.

## Reality

<!--
Where does phenonema reside? Where is it located? What is this place independent of our perceptions?

{Do noumenon preside in reality? By definition they are not. That would give them a location which is ascribing more knowledge than we have about them. }

{are phenomenon real? Yes, by the above definition}

{Is santa claus real? No, it does not exist separate from us as a thing-in-itself. (Though we realize it).. }
{WHat is the difference between the things-in-themselves and things we bring into reality?}
{I can generate a reality through thoughts. Populate it with phenomenon, but it is not a shared reality?}
{a phenomenon without a name is not a fact?}
{Knowing the name of something gives you power over it}
{YHWH. Not  named}
{Not real? In other words not in our reality? Interacts via sefirot?}
{another word for real?, etc.}
-->
## Existence

<!--
{If I imagine something, does it exist?}
{WHere do I exist}
{exist in reality, or exist elsewhere?}
{Is there only reality and the place where noumenon reside?}
{Do noumenon reside in reality as well but are unobtainable?}
-->

## Evidence

{Obtained through our senses directly, epistemology, perhaps revelation}

## Knowledge

> ...because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are
> known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also
> unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know
> <cite>Donald Rumsfeld</cite>

If we obtain one or more facts, we aren't necessarily aware of them.

## Real

## Hypothesis

## Truth

<!--
{There is a big difference between something being true, knowing that it is true, and knowing that you know it is true. We might say something is true if it is a theorem; we know that it's true if we know it is a theorem and there exists a proof; and we know that we know it's true if we can exhibit a proof that we understand.

If the first were the same as the last, then there would be no need for science or mathematics or objectively verifiable methods of argument. Furthermore, we would not be having this discussion in the first place, since truth would be self-evident, and so we could not possibly disagree.}

  Now scale that sentiment to a Deity: "I am that I am"

  From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_Sof>:

> Before He gave any shape to the world, before He produced any form, He was alone, without form and without
> resemblance to anything else. Who then can comprehend how He was before the Creation? Hence it is forbidden
> to lend Him any form or similitude, or even to call Him by His sacred name, or to indicate Him by a single
> letter or a single point...

> Any name of God which is found in the Bible can not be applied to the Deity prior to His self-manifestation
> in the Creation, because the letters of those names were produced only after the emanation. . . . Moreover,
> a name implies a limitation in its bearer; and this is impossible in connection with the "Ein Sof".

## Truth vs reality

  If something is "True", does it make it "Real"?

## Facts vs Evidence

Lawyers argue interpretation of facts. It's literally deriving an *ought* from an *is*.

When Scientists talk about evidence that doesn't seem to be the same thing as talking about facts.
*Evidence* seems to be tied directly to a particular theory whereas a *fact* may be just *information*

## Jordan Peterson on Phenomenology

The objective view of reality via science has limits

A subjective view involves the subject.

The union of self with reality.

It's one thing to ask "if a tree falls in the forest does it make a sound?"
and another to ask: "If there is no one around, is there a tree in the forest?"

All experience and feelings are considered reality and not a separate objective reality

## The Problem of Universals

Thomas Morgan
  I've been thinking a lot lately about the problem of universals.  What are your thoughts on this?
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_universals#:~:text=The%20problem%20of%20universals%20is,to%20exist%20beyond%20those%20objects%3F>

Michael Haufe
  I thought about this a bit last month and only made a little progress. My current scattered thoughts are:
  - Only directly numerical attributes of objects are used in scientific empiricism and not other attributes we might deem as "qualia"
  - This implies that these "qualia" are attributes of us and not the object. But are they?
  - An Objective view of reality demands a Subject / Object segregation.
  - Are these "objective" attributes like "length" only objective though? Can length be qualia?
  - What of phenomenon that can't be reproduced? Phenomenon of a single instance?
  - George Boole wrote a book called The Laws of Thought. Can there be an analogous Psychological/Archetypal laws? A so called "algebra"
    of Jung's efforts or of esoteric works which would capture some of these qualia?

Alfredo Liu-Perez
  Am I correct in saying that in the Game of Thrones novels some  universals are the characters in the novels? If so,
  those universals only exist in our imagination.

Michael Haufe
  If I tackle this as a fictionalist/nominalist/programmer: We've already solved this: the independent existence of such
  properties are referred to as Traits. The nature of their existence ends there per the definition of 'existence' to a Fictionalist.

Thomas Morgan
  If our current scientific theories are correct, even "length" is relative to the observer (due to length contraction in the theory
  of relativity).  Furthermore, since "color" is just wave length, color is also relative to the observer

Thomas Morgan
  I think "qualia" must be attributes of us because they are dependent upon our experience of a thing.  However, that does not mean
  that the thing we are experiencing as a "qualia" does not exist independently of us.  For example, when I see an object as red,
  it is because my brain is interpreting the wave length of the light reflecting off of an object in a certain way.  However, the
  wave itself surely exists independently of my having observed it.  And even though the measure of the wave length is dependent upon
  the observer measuring it, there is still some physical object that the observer is measuring to get that wavelength.  This is what
  is intended by the abstract (mathematical) notion of an "invariant".  A vector, say, can be represented using different coordinates,
  but the vector itself does not change.

Michael Haufe
  I think the problem that remains there is that you shift the burden to defining what the word "exists" means. when you say:
  "... that does not mean that the thing we are experiencing as a 'qualia' does not exist independently of us."

Michael Haufe
  nevermind the "independent" part, that would have to come later once you get the first word on a solid foundation

Michael Haufe
  Does Santa Claus "exist"? Does he "exist" "independent" of ourselves?

Michael Haufe
  What is the difference between the things-in-themselves and things we bring into "reality"?
  I can generate a "reality" through thoughts. Populate it, and "realize" it through invention and such.
  Do we not do the same with many of these labels such as "length"? We model our shared delusion with some
  framework, say "physics", we then convince each other of the utility of that framework so we have the same
  shared delusion.
  Or perhaps a better word is: a shared narrative instead of delusion.

Thomas Morgan
  The metaphysics of existence is a difficult topic, to be sure.  However, I am a realist.  When I was speaking
  of existence above, I was speaking in the context of physical objects, of the things-in-themselves.  Existence
  means something completely different when talking about ideas, concepts, abstractions, etc.  What I mean to say
  is that there actually is a physical object there to be observed.  The reason why we are capable of having shared
  narratives that are remarkably similar to each other is because there is an underlying reality independent of
  observers that we are all observing with similar senses.  One can argue about in what sense a universal exists,
  and that is why I posted this in the first place, but particulars, things-in-themselves, exist in a real, physical
  sense (at least I believe that to be true).  And while I acknowledge that we can never know with 100% certainty
  that what we experience as reality is in fact real, I believe that it is in fact so.

Michael Haufe
  and yet we know that below certain size scales under the empirical model we can not divorce subject from the observer

Michael Haufe
  So if the "thing-in-itself" can not be observed without our entanglement, then does it even count as phenomenon?

Michael Haufe
  we're limited to indirect inference and interpretation which goes back to our mental model: deriving an ought-from-an-is

Thomas Morgan
  We do not know that at small scales we can not divorce subject from observer.  That is only one interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Thomas Morgan
  Furthermore, empiricism can never yield an explanation as to the metaphysics of being or the reason why things are the way they are.
   It can only describe reality, in the same way that we can only experience reality filtered through our senses.

Michael Haufe
  And we also have to recall that "observer" has a specific definition in physics we have to be careful not to
  abuse (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(quantum_physics))

Michael Haufe
  right, we agree there

Alfredo Liu-Perez
  Can we say that existence is a matter of degree and changes through time? Like my existence is 100% now, but was much
  less before I was born and will be less after I die. Albert Einstein doesn't exist now but he did exist at one point.
```
One of the more unsettling discoveries in the past half century is that the universe is not locally real. “Real,” meaning that objects have definite properties independent of observation—an apple can be red even when no one is looking; “local” means objects can only be influenced by their surroundings, and that any influence cannot travel faster than light. Investigations at the frontiers of quantum physics have found that these things cannot both be true. Instead, the evidence shows objects are not influenced solely by their surroundings and they may also lack definite properties prior to measurement. As Albert Einstein famously bemoaned to a friend, “Do you really believe the moon is not there when you are not looking at it?”
```
<https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-universe-is-not-locally-real-and-the-physics-nobel-prize-winners-proved-it/>

Michael Haufe
  We can't say, that depends on your model of reality.

Alfredo Liu-Perez
  Or does "Albert Einstein", the name of that person, doesn't count as existing since it's just words invented by us to name something that exists.

Alfredo Liu-Perez
  This is deep. Very deep. Or maybe it's not deep and it just depends on our definition of existence.

Thomas Morgan
  Personally, I wouldn't say that existence is a matter of degree so much as it is a matter of kind.  Albert Einstein, as a temporal being,
  existed within a certain window of time and no longer exists (at least physically).  My understanding of Albert Einstein might be said
  to exist in the manner of an idea or a concept (if such things can be said to exist).  Because my understanding of Albert Einstein is
  based on my personal experience, that idea or concept cannot be said to exist independently of me, and so it lives and dies with me as
  an individual.  However, Albert Einstein, the myth, the legend, may live on beyond me as a sort of shared understanding or narrative.
  It is still dependent upon the people who know of Albert Einstein, but it is not solely dependent upon an individual.  Then there are
  concepts of mathematics or logic, tautological facts that some might argue have an existence entirely independent of people.  The argument
  might be that the reason that people must, when thinking correctly and logically, come up with the same answers is because those answers
  exist, in some sense, outside of the people who are considering them.

Michael Haufe
  It's one thing to ask "if a tree falls in the forest does it make a sound?"
  and another to ask: "If there is no one around, is there a tree in the forest?"

Thomas Morgan
  However, I would still answer yes to both questions

Michael Haufe
  If I speak something to a rock, what is it to the rock?

Thomas Morgan
  The rock is not conscious, and so can have no experience of the sound.  But the sound still exists as vibrations in the air

Alfredo Liu-Perez
  Is there a definition of existence we can use so we are all talking about the same thing?

Thomas Morgan
  That, ultimately, is the question at hand

Michael Haufe
  @alfredo.liu-perez hence the field of Ontology
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology>

Thomas Morgan
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology#Particulars_and_universals>

Alfredo Liu-Perez
  We can agree that existence is whatever is made of particles or waves.

Michael Haufe
  nope

Alfredo Liu-Perez
  crap

Michael Haufe
  we can't do that even.

Michael Haufe
  I mean, YOU can, which is fine.

Michael Haufe
  but until Physics became part of our zeitgeist, that was not reality (after Galileo)

Michael Haufe
  There were some ancient greeks who were "Atomists", but it was not popular

Michael Haufe
  and even in the modern day we don't think that's true. For example a Quark never exists on its own. it is always
  paired with at least one other quark. When we try to separate them, the energy we put into that separation spawns more quarks

Michael Haufe
  So the universe may be discrete, but may not be atomic? Which is a strange state of affairs in my mind

Michael Haufe
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement>

Alfredo Liu-Perez
  It think that's ok. things coming in and out of existence is fine. there was a particle/quark or a wave when it existed and none when it ceased to exist.

Michael Haufe
  except they don't do that either. recall the conservation laws.

Michael Haufe
  they always "exist" as either matter or energy

Michael Haufe
  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-universe-is-not-locally-real-and-the-physics-nobel-prize-winners-proved-it/#:~:text=Under%20quantum%20mechanics%2C%20nature%20is,another%20no%20matter%20the%20distance

Michael Haufe
  Which returns us to the question: what is a "thing-in-itself"?

Thomas Morgan
  I am inclined to give up locality before I give up realism

Michael Haufe
  I forgot to mention this before when you mentioned "underlying reality"
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unus_mundus>

Michael Haufe
  After refreshing myself on Eternalism, I'm slowly becoming more suspicious of locality as well
