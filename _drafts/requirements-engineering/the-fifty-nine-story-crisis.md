 William J. Lemessurier fulfilled his commitment to Standard of Care in the case of The Fifty-Nine-Story Crisis.  He demonstrated competence and concern in pursuing the correction of a potentially fatal design flaw in the Citicorp headquarters tower. This pursuit and concern can be seen by following the timeline of events after 1977 when the engineering student Diane Hartley initially raised the issue.

 Diane informed William that the bolted, diagonal support structures were insufficient to support the weight of the building during a high windstorm whereas if the support structures were welded, they would. William’s calculations initially called for welded beams as well, demonstrating his competence, but the cost of the implementation was beyond what Citicorp was willing to pay, and the engineers deemed it impractical and overkill for the building.  Without pushing the issue to far, he deferred to them at the time.

 Shortly thereafter, William decided to study the effects of wind that struck the wind at a 45 degree angle. Since the city building codes did not account for non-perpendicular winds, he was convinced that the did not consider them either when they decided to switch from welds to bolts. After performing the calculations, he discovered that indeed the supports were insufficient in a strong storm. He demonstrated care by calling a colleague to verify his calculations, and then working together to come up with a technical solution to the problem (wrapping steel “band-aids” at the failure points).

 Furthermore, William demonstrated care by informing the architecture firm, Citicorp, Insurance agencies, and the City without knowledge of the personal consequences as a result of the miscalculation and what had subsequently been determined to be under engineering.
