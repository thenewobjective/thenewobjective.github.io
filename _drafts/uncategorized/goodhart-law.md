Goodhart's law
	When a Measure Becomes a Target it ceases to be a good measure.

Three Examples:
	## Blood Pressure
	Blood pressure is considered an excellent measure for evaluating a person's general
	health.
	If a doctor had a morbidly obese patient enter their office, and the doctor
	measured their blood pressure it would undoubtedly be extremely high.
	If the doctor then focuses on lowering the patient's blood pressure by all
	manner of drugs, he could then claim he has improved the health of the patient
	because the measure has improved. Obviously the underlying cause has not been
	resolved. The measure, by becoming a target, has ceased being a good measure
	of health
	
	## Carbon Dioxide
	CO2 measurements are seen by some to be a measure for negative
	environmental impact by humans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere#Image_used_in_the_lead>
	The auto-industry is thus targeted by government regulators to reduce emissions

	As a consequence, you see some of the following:

	Additionally a push for electric vehicles and their associated environmental impacts such as:

	Then there's the Carbon Tax industry
	
	What is measuring CO2 a proxy for?
