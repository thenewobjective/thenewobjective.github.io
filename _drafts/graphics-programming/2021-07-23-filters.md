Being able to plot pixels and load images into a graphic is all well and good but sometimes there is a desire to apply changes
to a graphic after it has been created. Effects like blurring, sharpening, shifting colors, and more are what we'll tackle in this lesson.

To start we introduce the concept of a `Filter`:

```js
// lib/filters/Filter.js
import Graphic from '../Graphic.js'

class Filter extends Graphic {
    #graphic
    constructor({graphic}) {
        this.#graphic = graphic
    }
}
```

<!-->

The general idea is to apply an algorithm to the image data and return new image data.

Our first filter will be one to convert a graphic to [grayscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale). This filter accepts a single parameter: `amount` which
specifies the proportion of grayscale (`0%-100%`) to apply.

```js
// lib/filters/Grayscale.js
import Filter from './Filter.js'

class Grayscale extends Filter {
    #amount
    constructor({amount}) {
        super()
        this.#amount = amount
    }

    apply({imageData: {data, width, height}}) {
        const newData = new ImageData(data, width),
            {data: data2} = newData

        const bytes = 4,
              i = bytes * (width * y + x);
        if(x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= width || y >= height)
            return;
        data2[i + 0] = r;
        data2[i + 1] = g;
        data2[i + 2] = b;
        data2[i + 3] = a;


        return newData
    }
}
```
