There are many tutorials and books dedicated to graphics programming and programming on the web.
Personally I've felt that there is something missing. I've longed for a guide to graphics programming
in a declarative, simple style that has a breadth of coverage that I could use. I've given up on the
search and have decided to write the tutorial I wanted to see.

This guide will follow a declarative Object Oriented Design. It will utilize JavaScript and `<canvas>`.
The `<canvas>` drawing api's will not be used directly and will instead one will be built from scratch
by manipulating the canvas `ImageData` directly.
